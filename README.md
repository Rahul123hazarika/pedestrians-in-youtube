This repository contains code that extracts YouTube videos based on a mapping.csv file and performs object detection using YOLOv11. The primary objective of this work is to evaluate pedestrian behaviour in a cross-country or cross-cultural context using freely available YouTube videos.

This study presents a comprehensive cross-cultural evaluation of pedestrian behaviour during road crossings, examining variations between developed and developing states worldwide. As urban landscapes evolve and autonomous vehicles (AVs) become integral to future transportation, understanding pedestrian behaviour becomes paramount for ensuring safe interactions between humans and AVs. Through an extensive review of global pedestrian studies, we analyse key factors influencing crossing behaviour, such as cultural norms, socioeconomic factors, infrastructure development, and regulatory frameworks. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in pedestrian conduct across different regions. Developed states generally exhibit more structured and rule-oriented crossing behaviours, influenced by established traffic regulations and advanced infrastructure. In contrast, developing states often witness a higher degree of informal and adaptive behaviour due to limited infrastructure and diverse cultural influences. These insights underscore the necessity for AVs to adapt to diverse pedestrian behaviour on a global scale, emphasising the importance of incorporating cultural nuances into AV programming and decision-making algorithms. As the integration of AVs into urban environments accelerates, this research contributes valuable insights for enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous transportation systems. By recognising and accommodating diverse pedestrian behaviours, AVs can navigate complex and dynamic urban settings, ensuring a harmonious coexistence with human road users across the globe.

## Getting Started
Tested with Python 3.9.19. To setup the environment run these two commands in a parent folder of the downloaded repository (replace `/` with `\` and possibly add `--user` if on Windows:

**Step 1:**
Clone the repository
```command line
git clone https://github.com/Shaadalam9/pedestrians-in-youtube.git
```

**Step 2:**
Create a new virtual environment
```command line
python -m venv venv
