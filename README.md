## Overview
Welcome to the YOLOv8 YouTube Video Analysis project! This repository contains code that extracts YouTube videos based on a mapping.csv file and performs object detection using YOLOv8. The primary objective of this work is to evaluate pedestrian behavior in a cross-country or cross-cultural context using freely available YouTube videos.

## Usage of the code
The code is open-source and free to use. It is aimed for, but not limited to, academic research. We welcome forking of this repository, pull requests, and any contributions in the spirit of open science and open-source code üòçüòÑ For inquiries about collaboration, you may contact Pavlo Bazilinskyy (pavlo.bazilinskyy@gmail.com) or Md Shadab Alam (md_shadab_alam@outlook.com).

## Getting Started

**Step 1:**  

Clone the repository
```command line
git clone https://github.com/Shaadalam9/youtube-pedestrian.git
```

**Step 2:** 

Install Dependencies
```command line
