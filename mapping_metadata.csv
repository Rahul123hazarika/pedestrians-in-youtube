5,7NSGFFb_YJs,Italian Riviera 4K - Yachts & Seaside Resorts - Scenic Drive,10072021,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,375745,"Afternoon drive along the Italian Riviera, from the major seaport city of Genoa (Genova) to the picturesque harbour of Portofino.  Parking for YOUR Superyatch at Portofino is only $75,000 per month! ;) Yachts, cliffs, beaches, colorfully painted resorts, amazing Italian culture, along the Italian coastline.  I love Italian cities (I want to get an electric car or a motorcycle so I can ride in the ZTL) but the coastline is another level! Lots of American popular culture over the past 30 years focused Italy.  And the Italian coastline is a great representation of what makes Italy so great!  Hopefully this video helps until you get to visit in person! Starting Point:  https://goo.gl/maps/foicj9yXZ5biSgmF9 . The Italian Riviera.  As a tourist centre, the Italian Riviera benefits from over 300 days of sunshine per year, and is known for its beaches, colourfully painted towns, natural environment, food, and luxury villas and hotels, as well as for its popular resort facilities, major yachting and cruising areas with several marinas, festivals, golf courses, sailing, rock climbing and scenic views of centuries old farmhouses and cottages.  The Italian Riviera, or Ligurian Riviera, is the narrow coastal strip in Italy which lies between the Ligurian Sea and the mountain chain formed by the Maritime Alps and the Apennines. Longitudinally it extends from the border with France and the French Riviera (or Côte d'Azur) near Ventimiglia (a former customs post) eastwards to Capo Corvo (also known as Punta Bianca) which marks the eastern end of the Gulf of La Spezia and is close to the regional border between Liguria and Tuscany.   The mild climate draws an active tourist trade in the numerous coastal resorts, which include Alassio, Bonassola, Bordighera, Camogli, Cinque Terre, Lerici, Levanto, Noli, Portofino, Porto Venere, Santa Margherita Ligure, Sanremo, San Fruttuoso, and Sestri Levante. It is also known for its historical association with international celebrity and artistic visitors; writers and poets like Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Ezra Pound, and Ernest Hemingway were inspired by the beauty and spirit of the region.  Industries are concentrated in and around Genoa, Savona, and along the shores of the Gulf of La Spezia. Genoa and La Spezia are Italy’s leading shipyards; La Spezia is Italy’s major naval base, and Savona is a major centre of the Italian iron industry. Chemical, textile, and food industries are also important.  A number of streets and palaces in the center of Genoa and the Cinque Terre National Park (which includes Cinque Terre, Portovenere, and the islands Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto) are two of Italy's 55 World Heritage Sites.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Riviera  Genoa is the capital of the Italian region of Liguria and the sixth-largest city in Italy.  Genoa has historically been one of the most important ports on the Mediterranean: it is currently the busiest in Italy and in the Mediterranean Sea and twelfth-busiest in the European Union.  Genoa was the capital of one of the most powerful maritime republics for over seven centuries, from the 11th century to 1797. Particularly from the 12th century to the 15th century, the city played a leading role in the commercial trade in Europe, becoming one of the largest naval powers of the continent and considered among the wealthiest cities in the world.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa  Portofino (Portofin) is an Italian fishing village and holiday resort famous for its picturesque harbour and historical association with celebrity and artistic visitors. It is a comune located in the Metropolitan City of Genoa on the Italian Riviera. The town is clustered around its small harbour, and is known for the colourfully painted buildings that line the shore.  In Popular Culture: - In 1959 Dalida released song ""Love in Portofino"", written by Leo Chiosso and composed by Fred Buscaglione. With lyrics in French and Italian language, it became a hit and was later iconised alongside the village's name. It also spawned several international covers, including Andrea Bocelli's in 2013 which was followed by a concert recorded and issued on DVD. - Portofino is the eponym of Frank Schaeffer's Portofino: A Novel (1992). It was the first of Schaeffer's Calvin Becker Trilogy. - There is a full-scale replica, in authentic detail, of Portofino Bay at Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, USA, which opened in September 1999. - Portofino inspired in 2001 a recreation of the seaside town in the Mediterranean Harbor area at Tokyo Disney Sea in Chiba, Japan. It also served as the namesake for the restaurant Cafe Portofino. - Portofino was featured in 2008 in the television series Top Gear (Episode 5, Series 12). Richard Hammond, in a Ferrari Daytona raced James May in a carbon fibre powerboat from Portofino to St Tropez in France. - Ferrari named one of their new V8 sports cars after Portofino in 2017.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portofino",[],11,3062025

Given its size it was not hard to explore this tiny nation, so I recorded a full circuit of this island which took just 22 minutes. I hope you enjoy it!  ✈️ About me:  My name is Mark and I am from the UK.  In 2022 I sold my business after fifteen years of hard work and very few holidays. I immediately set out to make sure I enjoyed a well-earned ‘midlife crisis’. As I am too fat to fit in a Porsche, I settled quickly instead on going to the places I have dreamt of visiting, in airplane seats that I can fit in.

Let me know how it looks on your display please! Route: https://goo.gl/maps/J3gAMe5v1Wm3SDWk7 . Dorset is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast.  Dorset has a varied landscape featuring broad elevated chalk downs, steep limestone ridges and low-lying clay valleys. Over half the county is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Three-quarters of its coastline is part of the Jurassic Coast Natural World Heritage Site due to its geological and palaeontologic significance. It features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove, the Isle of Portland, Chesil Beach and Durdle Door. Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has become increasingly important to the economy. There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of A roads cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London. Dorset has ports at Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and an international airport near Bournemouth. The county has a variety of museums, theatres and festivals, and is host to the Great Dorset Steam Fair, one of the biggest events of its kind in Europe. It is the birthplace of Thomas Hardy, who used the county as the principal setting of his novels, and William Barnes, whose poetry celebrates the ancient Dorset dialect.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset  The Jurassic Coast is a World Heritage Site on the English Channel coast of southern England. It stretches from Exmouth in East Devon to Studland Bay in Dorset, a distance of about 96 miles (154 km), and was inscribed on the World Heritage List in mid-December 2001.  The site spans 185 million years of geological history, coastal erosion having exposed an almost continuous sequence of rock formation covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. At different times, this area has been desert, shallow tropical sea and marsh, and the fossilised remains of the various creatures that lived here have been preserved in the rocks.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Coast  https://www.dorsetaonb.org.uk/",[],8,3062025

The largest corral reef on the U.S. mainland.  One of my favorite places in the world!  I hope you enjoy! Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/z69nAvqkF4G9XPL27 . The Florida Keys are a coral cay archipelago located off the southern coast of Florida, forming the southernmost part of the continental United States. The area is popular for fishing and tourism, including ecotourism, with many visitors scuba diving in the area's protected waters.  The northern and central sections of the Florida Keys are the exposed portions of an ancient coral reef, the Key Largo Limestone.  They begin at the southeastern coast of the Florida peninsula, about 15 miles (24 km) south of Miami, and extend in a gentle arc south-southwest and then westward to Key West, the westernmost of the inhabited islands, and on to the uninhabited Dry Tortugas. The islands lie along the Florida Straits, dividing the Atlantic Ocean to the east from the Gulf of Mexico to the northwest, and defining one edge of Florida Bay. At the nearest point, the southern part of Key West is just 90 miles (140 km) from Cuba. The Florida Keys are between about 24.3 and 25.5 degrees North latitude.  The Overseas Highway is a 113-mile (181.9 km) highway carrying U.S. Route 1 (US 1) through the Florida Keys to Key West. Large parts of it were built on the former right-of-way of the Overseas Railroad, the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway. Completed in 1912, the Overseas Railroad was heavily damaged and partially destroyed in the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. The Florida East Coast Railway was financially unable to rebuild the destroyed sections, so the roadbed and remaining bridges were sold to the state of Florida for $640,000.  Since the 1950s the Overseas Highway has been refurbished into a main coastal highway between the cities of Miami and Key West, offering travelers an exotic roadway through a tropical savanna environment and access to the largest area of coral reefs on the U.S. mainland. Many exotic animals such as the American Alligator, American Crocodile and Key Deer inhabit the tropical islands of the Florida Keys.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Keys  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Highway",[],5,3062025

The Coast Road is a 7.3 kilometre stretch of road that is part of a major European Union transport corridor,  known as the TransEuropean Network for Transport (TEN-T).  The road has been widened and road alignments have been made to improve road safety. The road, which was previously  associated with fatal and grievous accidents, was upgraded to a two-lane dual carriage way with physical separation  between traffic travelling in each direction. The new road has made it easier to reach the northern side of Malta  from the centre of the island and has reduced journey times.

Andorra fun facts:  1. Andorra is the 16th smallest country in the world by land and the 11th smallest by population. It is only about a 40km drive from one side of the country to the other side. The total population of Andorra is only about 77,000 citizens and residents.   2. Andorra is the world’s only co-principality. A principality is a place ruled by a prince. Monaco is an example of a principality. Andorra, however, is a co-principality. They have two princes who jointly share the title of prince. Surprisingly, neither of the two princes are from Andorra. One prince is the President of France, Emmanuel Macron. The other co-prince is the Bishop of Urgell, who is currently Joan Enric Vives Sicília. The position is a constitutional one similar to the British Monarchy and holds no real power.  3. Andorra is the only country in the world with Catalan as its official language.  4. Andorra has never been in a war in almost 1,000 years. Given its non-strategic location in the Pyrenees Mountains and lack of natural resources, Andorra has been without conflict almost since Charlemagne came through to fight the Moors. Technically, Andorra did declare war on Germany in WWI, but it never sent anyone into the conflict. Given Andorra’s lack of participation in WWI, they were forgotten about in the Treaty of Versailles and didn’t officially declare peace with Germany until 1957!  5. Andorra has no national bank and has never had its own currency. Andorra currently uses the Euro as its currency. Before that, it primarily used the Spanish Peseta and sometimes the French Franc. There is no national bank in Andorra, so it has to use private banks if the country wants to incur debt.  6. Andorra is not part of the EU, EFTA, or the Eurozone. Andorra is not a member of most of the major European associations. Even though it uses the Euro, the country is not technically part of the Eurozone. It has a special relationship with the EU in which it follows the trade rules for the industry, but not for agriculture. It’s also not a party to the Schengen Treaty, however, you can only access Andorra via Spain and France, which are party to the treaty. And since Andorra doesn’t have an airport, it’s de facto subject to the agreement.  7. Andorra la Vella is the highest capital city in Europe. At an elevation of 1,023 meters (3356 feet), there is no higher elevation capital in all of Europe. In fact, it’s the 10th highest city of any kind in Europe and boasts a population of over 10,000.  8. Andorra has the most tourists per capita in the world. With over 10,000,000 visitors per year and a population of only 77,000, Andorra has the most visitors in the world per capita. The vast majority of the visitors to Andorra are Spanish and French citizens who go there to shop and purchase fuel at cheaper prices.  Enjoyed the video?

It shares borders with Argentina to its west and southwest and Brazil to its north and northeast; while bordering the Río de la Plata to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. It is part of the Southern Cone region of South America. Uruguay covers an area of approximately 181,034 square kilometers (69,898 sq mi) and has a population of an estimated 3.51 million, of whom 2 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. The area that became Uruguay was first inhabited by groups of hunter–gatherers 13,000 years ago. The predominant tribe at the moment of the arrival of Europeans was the Charrúa people, when the Portuguese first established Colónia do Sacramento in 1680; Uruguay was colonized by Europeans late relative to neighboring countries. The Spanish founded Montevideo as a military stronghold in the early 18th century because of the competing claims over the region. Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828, following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain, and later Argentina and Brazil. It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century, with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics. A series of economic crises and the political repression against left-wing guerrilla activity in the late 1960s and early 1970s put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century.

Sheep, stone walls, small villages, quiet streams, and stunning scenic countryside views!  Video begins in the small village of Penrhyndeudraeth, passes through Beddgelert, over Pen-y-Pass of Caernarfon, and ends in the village of Llanberis.  Unlike National Parks in America, you will find many residents within National Parks throughout the UK (more than 26,000 people live within Snowdonia National Park).  Filmed in 4K60FPS HDR H.265 and 4K30FPS SDR H.264.  This video is the H.265 version.  Please let me know if the video plays correctly on your display!   Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/w2i5tT6NCXMY2Q9e6 . Snowdonia is a region in northwest Wales concentrated around the mountains and glacial landforms of massive Snowdonia National Park. The park's historic Snowdon Mountain Railway climbs to the summit of Wales's highest mountain, Mount Snowdon, offering views across the sea to Ireland. The park is also home to an extensive network of trails, over 100 lakes and craggy peaks like Cader Idris and Tryfan. ― Google  Snowdonia (Welsh: Eryri) is a mountainous region in northwestern Wales and a national park of 823 square miles (2,130 km2) in area. It was the first to be designated of the three national parks in Wales, in 1951.  Snowdonia National Park (Welsh: Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri) was established in 1951 as the third national park in Britain, following the Peak District and the Lake District. It covers 827 square miles (2,140 km2), and has 37 miles (60 km) of coastline. The Snowdonia National Park covers parts of the counties of Gwynedd and Conwy.  The park is governed by the Snowdonia National Park Authority, which is made up of local government and Welsh Government representatives, and its main offices are at Penrhyndeudraeth. Unlike national parks in other countries, Snowdonia (and other such parks in Britain) is made up of both public and private lands under central planning authority.  More than 26,000 people live within the park. 58.6% of the population could speak Welsh in 2011.  While most of the land is either open or mountainous land, there is a significant amount of agricultural activity within the park.  Since the local government re-organisation of 1998, the park lies partly in the county of Gwynedd, and partly in the county borough of Conwy. It is governed by the 18-member Snowdonia National Park Authority; nine members are appointed by Gwynedd, 3 by Conwy, and the remaining six by the Welsh Government to represent the national interest. Unusually, Snowdonia National Park has a hole in the middle, around the town of Blaenau Ffestiniog, a slate quarrying centre. This was deliberately excluded from the park when it was set up to allow the development of new light industry to replace the reduced slate industry. (There is a similar situation in the Peak District National Park where the boundaries were drawn to exclude large built-up areas and industrial sites from the park with the town of Buxton and the adjacent quarries outside but surrounded on three sides by the park.) The Snowdonia Society is a registered charity formed in 1967. It is a voluntary group of people with an interest in the area and its protection.  Amory Lovins led the successful 1970s opposition to stop Rio Tinto digging up the area for a massive mine.  Climate Snowdonia is one of the wettest parts of the United Kingdom; Crib Goch in Snowdonia is the wettest spot in the United Kingdom, with an average rainfall of 4,473 millimetres (176.1 in) a year over the 30-year period prior to the mid-2000s. (There is a rainfall gauge at 713 metres, 2340' on the slopes below Crib Goch.)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdonia",[],3,03062025

With nearly twice as many tourists as the Grand Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United States with over 11.3 million recreational visitors in 2016. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is an American national park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site that straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The border between Tennessee and North Carolina runs northeast to southwest through the centerline of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Maine to Georgia. The park was chartered by the United States Congress in 1934 and officially dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.  The park encompasses 522,419 acres (816.28 sq mi; 211,415.47 ha; 2,114.15 km2), making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States. The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) at the towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and Cherokee, North Carolina. Great Smoky Mountains was the first national park whose land and other costs were paid for in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smoky_Mountains_National_Park",[],3,03062025

110,fZqP89ro0ro,Napa Valley 4K - California Vineyards - Scenic Drive,,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,206734,"Sunday afternoon drive through Napa Valley near San Francisco California along the popular Silverado Trail.  This area is the premier wine region of the USA and home to over 800 wineries.  The video starts in downtown Napa, continues along the Silverado Trail to Calistoga, and back towards downtown Napa.   Route: https://goo.gl/maps/KMf9qb5sq6TjGbfSA . Napa Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Napa County in California's Wine Country. Napa Valley is considered one of the premier wine regions in the world. Records of commercial wine production in the region date back to the nineteenth century, but premium wine production dates back only to the 1960s.  The combination of Mediterranean climate, geography and geology of the region are conducive to growing quality wine grapes. John Patchett established the Napa Valley's first commercial vineyard in 1858. In 1861 Charles Krug established another of Napa Valley's first commercial wineries in St. Helena. Viticulture in Napa suffered several setbacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including an outbreak of the vine disease phylloxera, the institution of Prohibition, and the Great Depression. The wine industry in Napa Valley recovered, and helped by the results of the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, came to be seen as capable of producing the best quality wine – equal to that of Old World wine regions. Napa Valley is now a major enotourism destination.  Napa Valley as a top wine region In 1976, the region got a boost from the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, which featured a Napa Valley Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon besting several famous French labels in a blind tasting format. The story of the wine competition, termed the ""Judgment of Paris"", was made into a Hollywood movie in 2008, called Bottle Shock. The results of this tasting cemented the region's reputation as a producer of world class wines.  A trend of larger national and international companies like E & J Gallo Winery, Diageo and Constellation Brands buying smaller wineries, vineyards and brands began to gain momentum in the early part of the 21st century. Today Napa Valley features more than 450 wineries that grow grape varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Merlot, Zinfandel, among others. While winemakers may produce wines from specific AVAs within the valley, many wines are made as a blend from grapes grown on the valley floor and the surrounding hillsides.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_Valley_AVA  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_Country  https://www.napavalley.com/guides/silverado-trail-wineries/  https://www.visitcalifornia.com/experience/napa-valleys-silverado-trail  https://www.wines.com/blog/the-silverado-trail/",[],3,03062025

The Rocky Mountains stretch 3,000 mi (4,800 km) in straight-line distance from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico in the Southwestern United States.   At the end of the last ice age, humans began inhabiting the mountain range. After explorations of the range by Europeans, natural resources such as mineral and fur drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains, although the range itself never experienced a dense population.  Of the 100 highest peaks in the Rocky Mountains, 78 (including the 30 highest) are located in Colorado, ten in Wyoming, six in New Mexico, three in Montana, and one in Utah. Public parks and forest lands protect much of the mountain range, and they are popular tourist destinations, especially for hiking, camping, mountaineering, fishing, hunting, mountain biking, skiing, and snowboarding.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains",[],3,03062025

143,SDibyW9WJl4,Driving Yellowstone in 8K HDR Dolby Vision - Bozeman Montana to Yellowstone National Park,,UCX_uGzVgYJuo_iuYSBqEr4g,380545,"Enjoy this 2.5 hour  road trip through the breathtaking landscapes of Montana, as we embark on a scenic drive from Bozeman to Yellowstone National Park. This journey promises a visual feast of majestic mountains, winding rivers, and the untamed beauty of the American West.  Starting our adventure in Bozeman, known for its vibrant culture and outdoor recreation, we'll set the stage for an incredible road trip. As we leave the town behind, the vast expanse of Montana's big sky country unfolds before us, with the Bridger Mountains to the northeast and the Gallatin Range to the south.  Our first destination is Paradise Valley, a name that perfectly captures the essence of this stunning region. The drive takes us along the Yellowstone River, with its crystal-clear waters reflecting the surrounding peaks. Lush green meadows, dotted with wildflowers, stretch out on either side of the road, creating a picture-perfect scene.   Moving onward, our journey leads us to Livingston, a charming town nestled along the banks of the Yellowstone River. Known for its historic architecture and artistic community, Livingston is a perfect pit stop. Explore the vibrant downtown area, grab a cup of coffee from a local cafe, and soak in the friendly atmosphere.  The town's railroad history is evident in the beautifully preserved Livingston Depot, a must-see for history buffs. Take a stroll along the Yellowstone River Trail for stunning views of the river and the Absaroka Mountains.  We then venture south towards Yellowstone National Park. The landscape becomes more rugged, with the Absaroka Mountains towering on the eastern side of the road. The iconic Roosevelt Arch marks the entrance to the park, and as you pass through, you'll feel the spirit of exploration and wonder that Yellowstone is known for.  Arriving at Mammoth Hot Springs, the geothermal features of Yellowstone take center state. The terraces of travertine formations, created by the flow of hot water over thousands of years, create a surreal and otherworldly landscape. The vibrant colors of the thermophiles add a unique touch to the scenery.   As the day draws to a close, the setting sun casts a warm glow over the landscape, creating a magical atmosphere. The geysers and hot springs take on a different character in the soft light, making for a spectacular end to our journey through Yellowstone.  #Yellowstone #Montana #drivingtour #wyoming #nationalpark #SunsetDrive #8k #HDR #ScenicRoadTrip #freeway  If you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe and I will create more videos like it.

As the wheels turn and the miles pass, I’m reminded that this journey isn’t just about distance—it’s about purpose. Today, I drive to meet some of the most humble yet faith-filled believers, people whose love for God radiates even amidst profound hardship. Although I go to bless them and encourage them, the reality is that I'm the one who receives the greater blessings.  Their hearts are rich with a devotion that inspires our ministry every day. It’s a privilege to carry hope to those who, though poor in material wealth, are immeasurably rich in spirit.  Let this be a reminder to us all: where love for God abounds, no soul is truly impoverished. Together, we are part of something far greater than ourselves - a family united in His name.

This route offers a captivating blend of rugged natural beauty, historic landmarks, and endless open roads, perfect for travelers and adventurers alike.  Starting in Badlands National Park, witness the park’s striking formations, eroded buttes, and vast prairies as we navigate through its winding roads. We’ll then head westward, making our way through South Dakota’s quintessential Great Plains scenery, passing rolling hills, wide-open fields, and small towns that echo the charm of the Midwest.  As we approach the Black Hills, the landscape shifts to towering pines and rocky outcrops. Our final destination is none other than the national monument of Mount Rushmore. Here, the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln stand proudly against the backdrop of the Black Hills, commemorating the legacy of American history.  About the Badlands:  Badlands National Park, located in southwestern South Dakota, is a place of incredible geological and cultural history. Millions of years ago, this region was an ancient seabed, covered by water that gradually receded, leaving behind layers of sediment. Over time, these layers were compressed and transformed into the colorful rock formations we see today. The park’s sharply eroded buttes, pinnacles, and spires were sculpted by wind and water, creating a landscape that appears both timeless and otherworldly.  For thousands of years, Native American tribes, including the Lakota Sioux, called this land home. The name ""badlands"" comes from the Lakota phrase ""mako sica,"" which means ""bad land."" The term reflects the rugged terrain and harsh conditions, which posed challenges for early travelers and settlers. However, the Badlands also served as a place of spiritual and cultural significance, with the Lakota finding shelter, hunting grounds, and sacred sites within the cliffs and canyons.

From Wikipedia: Panama City Beach is a resort town in Bay County, Florida, United States, on the Gulf of Mexico coast. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 12,018. The city is often referred to under the umbrella term of ""Panama City"". Panama City Beach's slogan is ""The World's Most Beautiful Beaches"" due to the unique,[ sugar-white sandy beaches of northwest Florida.  Panama City Beach is a popular vacation destination, especially among people in the Southern United States. The city is also a popular spring break destination, due to its beach and proximity to most of the Southern United States. The first two seasons of MTV’s Floribama Shore were filmed in the city.  A construction boom in the early to mid 2000s changed the image of the area due to the older homes and motels being replaced with high-rise condominiums and more expansive homes. However, this is turning unobstructed, low-rise beach views and affordable waterfront property into rarities. At the peak of the real estate boom, many beachfront properties had quadrupled or more in value since 2000. In November 2006 CNN/Money named Panama City Beach the No. 1 real estate market in America for the next five years in Beachfront property has sold for upwards of $60,000 per ""front foot"" (linear foot) at the top of the market. The downturn in the U.S. real estate market in 2007, combined with a surge of new condo construction, brought spiraling prices somewhat under control. With the real estate boom, Panama City Beach became a well known destination for spring break.  Category 5 Hurricane Michael made landfall near Mexico Beach in Bay County on October 10, 2018, becoming one of the strongest and most-destructive hurricanes in American history as it destroyed a large part of the county, including many structures in Mexico Beach and Panama City. An EF-0 tornado did minor damage to the northwest part of Panama City Beach, Florida on February 15th.Tornadoes of 2021",[],2,03062025
