5,7NSGFFb_YJs,Italian Riviera 4K - Yachts & Seaside Resorts - Scenic Drive,10072021,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,375745,"Afternoon drive along the Italian Riviera, from the major seaport city of Genoa (Genova) to the picturesque harbour of Portofino.  Parking for YOUR Superyatch at Portofino is only $75,000 per month! ;) Yachts, cliffs, beaches, colorfully painted resorts, amazing Italian culture, along the Italian coastline.  I love Italian cities (I want to get an electric car or a motorcycle so I can ride in the ZTL) but the coastline is another level! Lots of American popular culture over the past 30 years focused Italy.  And the Italian coastline is a great representation of what makes Italy so great!  Hopefully this video helps until you get to visit in person! Starting Point:  https://goo.gl/maps/foicj9yXZ5biSgmF9 . The Italian Riviera.  As a tourist centre, the Italian Riviera benefits from over 300 days of sunshine per year, and is known for its beaches, colourfully painted towns, natural environment, food, and luxury villas and hotels, as well as for its popular resort facilities, major yachting and cruising areas with several marinas, festivals, golf courses, sailing, rock climbing and scenic views of centuries old farmhouses and cottages.  The Italian Riviera, or Ligurian Riviera, is the narrow coastal strip in Italy which lies between the Ligurian Sea and the mountain chain formed by the Maritime Alps and the Apennines. Longitudinally it extends from the border with France and the French Riviera (or Côte d'Azur) near Ventimiglia (a former customs post) eastwards to Capo Corvo (also known as Punta Bianca) which marks the eastern end of the Gulf of La Spezia and is close to the regional border between Liguria and Tuscany.   The mild climate draws an active tourist trade in the numerous coastal resorts, which include Alassio, Bonassola, Bordighera, Camogli, Cinque Terre, Lerici, Levanto, Noli, Portofino, Porto Venere, Santa Margherita Ligure, Sanremo, San Fruttuoso, and Sestri Levante. It is also known for its historical association with international celebrity and artistic visitors; writers and poets like Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Ezra Pound, and Ernest Hemingway were inspired by the beauty and spirit of the region.  Industries are concentrated in and around Genoa, Savona, and along the shores of the Gulf of La Spezia. Genoa and La Spezia are Italy’s leading shipyards; La Spezia is Italy’s major naval base, and Savona is a major centre of the Italian iron industry. Chemical, textile, and food industries are also important.  A number of streets and palaces in the center of Genoa and the Cinque Terre National Park (which includes Cinque Terre, Portovenere, and the islands Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto) are two of Italy's 55 World Heritage Sites.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Riviera  Genoa is the capital of the Italian region of Liguria and the sixth-largest city in Italy.  Genoa has historically been one of the most important ports on the Mediterranean: it is currently the busiest in Italy and in the Mediterranean Sea and twelfth-busiest in the European Union.  Genoa was the capital of one of the most powerful maritime republics for over seven centuries, from the 11th century to 1797. Particularly from the 12th century to the 15th century, the city played a leading role in the commercial trade in Europe, becoming one of the largest naval powers of the continent and considered among the wealthiest cities in the world.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa  Portofino (Portofin) is an Italian fishing village and holiday resort famous for its picturesque harbour and historical association with celebrity and artistic visitors. It is a comune located in the Metropolitan City of Genoa on the Italian Riviera. The town is clustered around its small harbour, and is known for the colourfully painted buildings that line the shore.  In Popular Culture: - In 1959 Dalida released song ""Love in Portofino"", written by Leo Chiosso and composed by Fred Buscaglione. With lyrics in French and Italian language, it became a hit and was later iconised alongside the village's name. It also spawned several international covers, including Andrea Bocelli's in 2013 which was followed by a concert recorded and issued on DVD. - Portofino is the eponym of Frank Schaeffer's Portofino: A Novel (1992). It was the first of Schaeffer's Calvin Becker Trilogy. - There is a full-scale replica, in authentic detail, of Portofino Bay at Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, USA, which opened in September 1999. - Portofino inspired in 2001 a recreation of the seaside town in the Mediterranean Harbor area at Tokyo Disney Sea in Chiba, Japan. It also served as the namesake for the restaurant Cafe Portofino. - Portofino was featured in 2008 in the television series Top Gear (Episode 5, Series 12). Richard Hammond, in a Ferrari Daytona raced James May in a carbon fibre powerboat from Portofino to St Tropez in France. - Ferrari named one of their new V8 sports cars after Portofino in 2017.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portofino",[],11,3062025

Given its size it was not hard to explore this tiny nation, so I recorded a full circuit of this island which took just 22 minutes. I hope you enjoy it!  ✈️ About me:  My name is Mark and I am from the UK.  In 2022 I sold my business after fifteen years of hard work and very few holidays. I immediately set out to make sure I enjoyed a well-earned ‘midlife crisis’. As I am too fat to fit in a Porsche, I settled quickly instead on going to the places I have dreamt of visiting, in airplane seats that I can fit in.

Let me know how it looks on your display please! Route: https://goo.gl/maps/J3gAMe5v1Wm3SDWk7 . Dorset is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast.  Dorset has a varied landscape featuring broad elevated chalk downs, steep limestone ridges and low-lying clay valleys. Over half the county is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Three-quarters of its coastline is part of the Jurassic Coast Natural World Heritage Site due to its geological and palaeontologic significance. It features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove, the Isle of Portland, Chesil Beach and Durdle Door. Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has become increasingly important to the economy. There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of A roads cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London. Dorset has ports at Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and an international airport near Bournemouth. The county has a variety of museums, theatres and festivals, and is host to the Great Dorset Steam Fair, one of the biggest events of its kind in Europe. It is the birthplace of Thomas Hardy, who used the county as the principal setting of his novels, and William Barnes, whose poetry celebrates the ancient Dorset dialect.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset  The Jurassic Coast is a World Heritage Site on the English Channel coast of southern England. It stretches from Exmouth in East Devon to Studland Bay in Dorset, a distance of about 96 miles (154 km), and was inscribed on the World Heritage List in mid-December 2001.  The site spans 185 million years of geological history, coastal erosion having exposed an almost continuous sequence of rock formation covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. At different times, this area has been desert, shallow tropical sea and marsh, and the fossilised remains of the various creatures that lived here have been preserved in the rocks.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Coast  https://www.dorsetaonb.org.uk/",[],8,3062025

44,KDrVpkbwcbg,Florida Keys 4K - Tropical Islands - Scenic Drive,20092020,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,478708,"Afternoon drive through the tropical Florida Keys island chain along the Overseas Highway, home to exotic alligators, pricy real estate, clear ocean and amazing ecotourism.  The largest corral reef on the U.S. mainland.  One of my favorite places in the world!  I hope you enjoy! Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/z69nAvqkF4G9XPL27 . The Florida Keys are a coral cay archipelago located off the southern coast of Florida, forming the southernmost part of the continental United States. The area is popular for fishing and tourism, including ecotourism, with many visitors scuba diving in the area's protected waters.  The northern and central sections of the Florida Keys are the exposed portions of an ancient coral reef, the Key Largo Limestone.  They begin at the southeastern coast of the Florida peninsula, about 15 miles (24 km) south of Miami, and extend in a gentle arc south-southwest and then westward to Key West, the westernmost of the inhabited islands, and on to the uninhabited Dry Tortugas. The islands lie along the Florida Straits, dividing the Atlantic Ocean to the east from the Gulf of Mexico to the northwest, and defining one edge of Florida Bay. At the nearest point, the southern part of Key West is just 90 miles (140 km) from Cuba. The Florida Keys are between about 24.3 and 25.5 degrees North latitude.  The Overseas Highway is a 113-mile (181.9 km) highway carrying U.S. Route 1 (US 1) through the Florida Keys to Key West. Large parts of it were built on the former right-of-way of the Overseas Railroad, the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway. Completed in 1912, the Overseas Railroad was heavily damaged and partially destroyed in the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. The Florida East Coast Railway was financially unable to rebuild the destroyed sections, so the roadbed and remaining bridges were sold to the state of Florida for $640,000.  Since the 1950s the Overseas Highway has been refurbished into a main coastal highway between the cities of Miami and Key West, offering travelers an exotic roadway through a tropical savanna environment and access to the largest area of coral reefs on the U.S. mainland. Many exotic animals such as the American Alligator, American Crocodile and Key Deer inhabit the tropical islands of the Florida Keys.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Keys  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Highway",[],5,3062025
