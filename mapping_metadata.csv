5,7NSGFFb_YJs,Italian Riviera 4K - Yachts & Seaside Resorts - Scenic Drive,10072021,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,375745,"Afternoon drive along the Italian Riviera, from the major seaport city of Genoa (Genova) to the picturesque harbour of Portofino.  Parking for YOUR Superyatch at Portofino is only $75,000 per month! ;) Yachts, cliffs, beaches, colorfully painted resorts, amazing Italian culture, along the Italian coastline.  I love Italian cities (I want to get an electric car or a motorcycle so I can ride in the ZTL) but the coastline is another level! Lots of American popular culture over the past 30 years focused Italy.  And the Italian coastline is a great representation of what makes Italy so great!  Hopefully this video helps until you get to visit in person! Starting Point:  https://goo.gl/maps/foicj9yXZ5biSgmF9 . The Italian Riviera.  As a tourist centre, the Italian Riviera benefits from over 300 days of sunshine per year, and is known for its beaches, colourfully painted towns, natural environment, food, and luxury villas and hotels, as well as for its popular resort facilities, major yachting and cruising areas with several marinas, festivals, golf courses, sailing, rock climbing and scenic views of centuries old farmhouses and cottages.  The Italian Riviera, or Ligurian Riviera, is the narrow coastal strip in Italy which lies between the Ligurian Sea and the mountain chain formed by the Maritime Alps and the Apennines. Longitudinally it extends from the border with France and the French Riviera (or Côte d'Azur) near Ventimiglia (a former customs post) eastwards to Capo Corvo (also known as Punta Bianca) which marks the eastern end of the Gulf of La Spezia and is close to the regional border between Liguria and Tuscany.   The mild climate draws an active tourist trade in the numerous coastal resorts, which include Alassio, Bonassola, Bordighera, Camogli, Cinque Terre, Lerici, Levanto, Noli, Portofino, Porto Venere, Santa Margherita Ligure, Sanremo, San Fruttuoso, and Sestri Levante. It is also known for its historical association with international celebrity and artistic visitors; writers and poets like Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Ezra Pound, and Ernest Hemingway were inspired by the beauty and spirit of the region.  Industries are concentrated in and around Genoa, Savona, and along the shores of the Gulf of La Spezia. Genoa and La Spezia are Italy’s leading shipyards; La Spezia is Italy’s major naval base, and Savona is a major centre of the Italian iron industry. Chemical, textile, and food industries are also important.  A number of streets and palaces in the center of Genoa and the Cinque Terre National Park (which includes Cinque Terre, Portovenere, and the islands Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto) are two of Italy's 55 World Heritage Sites.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Riviera  Genoa is the capital of the Italian region of Liguria and the sixth-largest city in Italy.  Genoa has historically been one of the most important ports on the Mediterranean: it is currently the busiest in Italy and in the Mediterranean Sea and twelfth-busiest in the European Union.  Genoa was the capital of one of the most powerful maritime republics for over seven centuries, from the 11th century to 1797. Particularly from the 12th century to the 15th century, the city played a leading role in the commercial trade in Europe, becoming one of the largest naval powers of the continent and considered among the wealthiest cities in the world.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa  Portofino (Portofin) is an Italian fishing village and holiday resort famous for its picturesque harbour and historical association with celebrity and artistic visitors. It is a comune located in the Metropolitan City of Genoa on the Italian Riviera. The town is clustered around its small harbour, and is known for the colourfully painted buildings that line the shore.  In Popular Culture: - In 1959 Dalida released song ""Love in Portofino"", written by Leo Chiosso and composed by Fred Buscaglione. With lyrics in French and Italian language, it became a hit and was later iconised alongside the village's name. It also spawned several international covers, including Andrea Bocelli's in 2013 which was followed by a concert recorded and issued on DVD. - Portofino is the eponym of Frank Schaeffer's Portofino: A Novel (1992). It was the first of Schaeffer's Calvin Becker Trilogy. - There is a full-scale replica, in authentic detail, of Portofino Bay at Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, USA, which opened in September 1999. - Portofino inspired in 2001 a recreation of the seaside town in the Mediterranean Harbor area at Tokyo Disney Sea in Chiba, Japan. It also served as the namesake for the restaurant Cafe Portofino. - Portofino was featured in 2008 in the television series Top Gear (Episode 5, Series 12). Richard Hammond, in a Ferrari Daytona raced James May in a carbon fibre powerboat from Portofino to St Tropez in France. - Ferrari named one of their new V8 sports cars after Portofino in 2017.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portofino",[],11,3062025

Given its size it was not hard to explore this tiny nation, so I recorded a full circuit of this island which took just 22 minutes. I hope you enjoy it!  ✈️ About me:  My name is Mark and I am from the UK.  In 2022 I sold my business after fifteen years of hard work and very few holidays. I immediately set out to make sure I enjoyed a well-earned ‘midlife crisis’. As I am too fat to fit in a Porsche, I settled quickly instead on going to the places I have dreamt of visiting, in airplane seats that I can fit in.

Let me know how it looks on your display please! Route: https://goo.gl/maps/J3gAMe5v1Wm3SDWk7 . Dorset is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast.  Dorset has a varied landscape featuring broad elevated chalk downs, steep limestone ridges and low-lying clay valleys. Over half the county is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Three-quarters of its coastline is part of the Jurassic Coast Natural World Heritage Site due to its geological and palaeontologic significance. It features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove, the Isle of Portland, Chesil Beach and Durdle Door. Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has become increasingly important to the economy. There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of A roads cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London. Dorset has ports at Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and an international airport near Bournemouth. The county has a variety of museums, theatres and festivals, and is host to the Great Dorset Steam Fair, one of the biggest events of its kind in Europe. It is the birthplace of Thomas Hardy, who used the county as the principal setting of his novels, and William Barnes, whose poetry celebrates the ancient Dorset dialect.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset  The Jurassic Coast is a World Heritage Site on the English Channel coast of southern England. It stretches from Exmouth in East Devon to Studland Bay in Dorset, a distance of about 96 miles (154 km), and was inscribed on the World Heritage List in mid-December 2001.  The site spans 185 million years of geological history, coastal erosion having exposed an almost continuous sequence of rock formation covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. At different times, this area has been desert, shallow tropical sea and marsh, and the fossilised remains of the various creatures that lived here have been preserved in the rocks.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Coast  https://www.dorsetaonb.org.uk/",[],8,3062025

The largest corral reef on the U.S. mainland.  One of my favorite places in the world!  I hope you enjoy! Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/z69nAvqkF4G9XPL27 . The Florida Keys are a coral cay archipelago located off the southern coast of Florida, forming the southernmost part of the continental United States. The area is popular for fishing and tourism, including ecotourism, with many visitors scuba diving in the area's protected waters.  The northern and central sections of the Florida Keys are the exposed portions of an ancient coral reef, the Key Largo Limestone.  They begin at the southeastern coast of the Florida peninsula, about 15 miles (24 km) south of Miami, and extend in a gentle arc south-southwest and then westward to Key West, the westernmost of the inhabited islands, and on to the uninhabited Dry Tortugas. The islands lie along the Florida Straits, dividing the Atlantic Ocean to the east from the Gulf of Mexico to the northwest, and defining one edge of Florida Bay. At the nearest point, the southern part of Key West is just 90 miles (140 km) from Cuba. The Florida Keys are between about 24.3 and 25.5 degrees North latitude.  The Overseas Highway is a 113-mile (181.9 km) highway carrying U.S. Route 1 (US 1) through the Florida Keys to Key West. Large parts of it were built on the former right-of-way of the Overseas Railroad, the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway. Completed in 1912, the Overseas Railroad was heavily damaged and partially destroyed in the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. The Florida East Coast Railway was financially unable to rebuild the destroyed sections, so the roadbed and remaining bridges were sold to the state of Florida for $640,000.  Since the 1950s the Overseas Highway has been refurbished into a main coastal highway between the cities of Miami and Key West, offering travelers an exotic roadway through a tropical savanna environment and access to the largest area of coral reefs on the U.S. mainland. Many exotic animals such as the American Alligator, American Crocodile and Key Deer inhabit the tropical islands of the Florida Keys.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Keys  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Highway",[],5,3062025

The Coast Road is a 7.3 kilometre stretch of road that is part of a major European Union transport corridor,  known as the TransEuropean Network for Transport (TEN-T).  The road has been widened and road alignments have been made to improve road safety. The road, which was previously  associated with fatal and grievous accidents, was upgraded to a two-lane dual carriage way with physical separation  between traffic travelling in each direction. The new road has made it easier to reach the northern side of Malta  from the centre of the island and has reduced journey times.

Andorra fun facts:  1. Andorra is the 16th smallest country in the world by land and the 11th smallest by population. It is only about a 40km drive from one side of the country to the other side. The total population of Andorra is only about 77,000 citizens and residents.   2. Andorra is the world’s only co-principality. A principality is a place ruled by a prince. Monaco is an example of a principality. Andorra, however, is a co-principality. They have two princes who jointly share the title of prince. Surprisingly, neither of the two princes are from Andorra. One prince is the President of France, Emmanuel Macron. The other co-prince is the Bishop of Urgell, who is currently Joan Enric Vives Sicília. The position is a constitutional one similar to the British Monarchy and holds no real power.  3. Andorra is the only country in the world with Catalan as its official language.  4. Andorra has never been in a war in almost 1,000 years. Given its non-strategic location in the Pyrenees Mountains and lack of natural resources, Andorra has been without conflict almost since Charlemagne came through to fight the Moors. Technically, Andorra did declare war on Germany in WWI, but it never sent anyone into the conflict. Given Andorra’s lack of participation in WWI, they were forgotten about in the Treaty of Versailles and didn’t officially declare peace with Germany until 1957!  5. Andorra has no national bank and has never had its own currency. Andorra currently uses the Euro as its currency. Before that, it primarily used the Spanish Peseta and sometimes the French Franc. There is no national bank in Andorra, so it has to use private banks if the country wants to incur debt.  6. Andorra is not part of the EU, EFTA, or the Eurozone. Andorra is not a member of most of the major European associations. Even though it uses the Euro, the country is not technically part of the Eurozone. It has a special relationship with the EU in which it follows the trade rules for the industry, but not for agriculture. It’s also not a party to the Schengen Treaty, however, you can only access Andorra via Spain and France, which are party to the treaty. And since Andorra doesn’t have an airport, it’s de facto subject to the agreement.  7. Andorra la Vella is the highest capital city in Europe. At an elevation of 1,023 meters (3356 feet), there is no higher elevation capital in all of Europe. In fact, it’s the 10th highest city of any kind in Europe and boasts a population of over 10,000.  8. Andorra has the most tourists per capita in the world. With over 10,000,000 visitors per year and a population of only 77,000, Andorra has the most visitors in the world per capita. The vast majority of the visitors to Andorra are Spanish and French citizens who go there to shop and purchase fuel at cheaper prices.  Enjoyed the video?

It shares borders with Argentina to its west and southwest and Brazil to its north and northeast; while bordering the Río de la Plata to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. It is part of the Southern Cone region of South America. Uruguay covers an area of approximately 181,034 square kilometers (69,898 sq mi) and has a population of an estimated 3.51 million, of whom 2 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. The area that became Uruguay was first inhabited by groups of hunter–gatherers 13,000 years ago. The predominant tribe at the moment of the arrival of Europeans was the Charrúa people, when the Portuguese first established Colónia do Sacramento in 1680; Uruguay was colonized by Europeans late relative to neighboring countries. The Spanish founded Montevideo as a military stronghold in the early 18th century because of the competing claims over the region. Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828, following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain, and later Argentina and Brazil. It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century, with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics. A series of economic crises and the political repression against left-wing guerrilla activity in the late 1960s and early 1970s put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century.

Sheep, stone walls, small villages, quiet streams, and stunning scenic countryside views!  Video begins in the small village of Penrhyndeudraeth, passes through Beddgelert, over Pen-y-Pass of Caernarfon, and ends in the village of Llanberis.  Unlike National Parks in America, you will find many residents within National Parks throughout the UK (more than 26,000 people live within Snowdonia National Park).  Filmed in 4K60FPS HDR H.265 and 4K30FPS SDR H.264.  This video is the H.265 version.  Please let me know if the video plays correctly on your display!   Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/w2i5tT6NCXMY2Q9e6 . Snowdonia is a region in northwest Wales concentrated around the mountains and glacial landforms of massive Snowdonia National Park. The park's historic Snowdon Mountain Railway climbs to the summit of Wales's highest mountain, Mount Snowdon, offering views across the sea to Ireland. The park is also home to an extensive network of trails, over 100 lakes and craggy peaks like Cader Idris and Tryfan. ― Google  Snowdonia (Welsh: Eryri) is a mountainous region in northwestern Wales and a national park of 823 square miles (2,130 km2) in area. It was the first to be designated of the three national parks in Wales, in 1951.  Snowdonia National Park (Welsh: Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri) was established in 1951 as the third national park in Britain, following the Peak District and the Lake District. It covers 827 square miles (2,140 km2), and has 37 miles (60 km) of coastline. The Snowdonia National Park covers parts of the counties of Gwynedd and Conwy.  The park is governed by the Snowdonia National Park Authority, which is made up of local government and Welsh Government representatives, and its main offices are at Penrhyndeudraeth. Unlike national parks in other countries, Snowdonia (and other such parks in Britain) is made up of both public and private lands under central planning authority.  More than 26,000 people live within the park. 58.6% of the population could speak Welsh in 2011.  While most of the land is either open or mountainous land, there is a significant amount of agricultural activity within the park.  Since the local government re-organisation of 1998, the park lies partly in the county of Gwynedd, and partly in the county borough of Conwy. It is governed by the 18-member Snowdonia National Park Authority; nine members are appointed by Gwynedd, 3 by Conwy, and the remaining six by the Welsh Government to represent the national interest. Unusually, Snowdonia National Park has a hole in the middle, around the town of Blaenau Ffestiniog, a slate quarrying centre. This was deliberately excluded from the park when it was set up to allow the development of new light industry to replace the reduced slate industry. (There is a similar situation in the Peak District National Park where the boundaries were drawn to exclude large built-up areas and industrial sites from the park with the town of Buxton and the adjacent quarries outside but surrounded on three sides by the park.) The Snowdonia Society is a registered charity formed in 1967. It is a voluntary group of people with an interest in the area and its protection.  Amory Lovins led the successful 1970s opposition to stop Rio Tinto digging up the area for a massive mine.  Climate Snowdonia is one of the wettest parts of the United Kingdom; Crib Goch in Snowdonia is the wettest spot in the United Kingdom, with an average rainfall of 4,473 millimetres (176.1 in) a year over the 30-year period prior to the mid-2000s. (There is a rainfall gauge at 713 metres, 2340' on the slopes below Crib Goch.)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdonia",[],3,03062025

With nearly twice as many tourists as the Grand Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United States with over 11.3 million recreational visitors in 2016. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is an American national park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site that straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The border between Tennessee and North Carolina runs northeast to southwest through the centerline of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Maine to Georgia. The park was chartered by the United States Congress in 1934 and officially dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.  The park encompasses 522,419 acres (816.28 sq mi; 211,415.47 ha; 2,114.15 km2), making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States. The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) at the towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and Cherokee, North Carolina. Great Smoky Mountains was the first national park whose land and other costs were paid for in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smoky_Mountains_National_Park",[],3,03062025

110,fZqP89ro0ro,Napa Valley 4K - California Vineyards - Scenic Drive,,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,206734,"Sunday afternoon drive through Napa Valley near San Francisco California along the popular Silverado Trail.  This area is the premier wine region of the USA and home to over 800 wineries.  The video starts in downtown Napa, continues along the Silverado Trail to Calistoga, and back towards downtown Napa.   Route: https://goo.gl/maps/KMf9qb5sq6TjGbfSA . Napa Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Napa County in California's Wine Country. Napa Valley is considered one of the premier wine regions in the world. Records of commercial wine production in the region date back to the nineteenth century, but premium wine production dates back only to the 1960s.  The combination of Mediterranean climate, geography and geology of the region are conducive to growing quality wine grapes. John Patchett established the Napa Valley's first commercial vineyard in 1858. In 1861 Charles Krug established another of Napa Valley's first commercial wineries in St. Helena. Viticulture in Napa suffered several setbacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including an outbreak of the vine disease phylloxera, the institution of Prohibition, and the Great Depression. The wine industry in Napa Valley recovered, and helped by the results of the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, came to be seen as capable of producing the best quality wine – equal to that of Old World wine regions. Napa Valley is now a major enotourism destination.  Napa Valley as a top wine region In 1976, the region got a boost from the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, which featured a Napa Valley Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon besting several famous French labels in a blind tasting format. The story of the wine competition, termed the ""Judgment of Paris"", was made into a Hollywood movie in 2008, called Bottle Shock. The results of this tasting cemented the region's reputation as a producer of world class wines.  A trend of larger national and international companies like E & J Gallo Winery, Diageo and Constellation Brands buying smaller wineries, vineyards and brands began to gain momentum in the early part of the 21st century. Today Napa Valley features more than 450 wineries that grow grape varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Merlot, Zinfandel, among others. While winemakers may produce wines from specific AVAs within the valley, many wines are made as a blend from grapes grown on the valley floor and the surrounding hillsides.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_Valley_AVA  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_Country  https://www.napavalley.com/guides/silverado-trail-wineries/  https://www.visitcalifornia.com/experience/napa-valleys-silverado-trail  https://www.wines.com/blog/the-silverado-trail/",[],3,03062025

The Rocky Mountains stretch 3,000 mi (4,800 km) in straight-line distance from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico in the Southwestern United States.   At the end of the last ice age, humans began inhabiting the mountain range. After explorations of the range by Europeans, natural resources such as mineral and fur drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains, although the range itself never experienced a dense population.  Of the 100 highest peaks in the Rocky Mountains, 78 (including the 30 highest) are located in Colorado, ten in Wyoming, six in New Mexico, three in Montana, and one in Utah. Public parks and forest lands protect much of the mountain range, and they are popular tourist destinations, especially for hiking, camping, mountaineering, fishing, hunting, mountain biking, skiing, and snowboarding.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains",[],3,03062025

143,SDibyW9WJl4,Driving Yellowstone in 8K HDR Dolby Vision - Bozeman Montana to Yellowstone National Park,,UCX_uGzVgYJuo_iuYSBqEr4g,380545,"Enjoy this 2.5 hour  road trip through the breathtaking landscapes of Montana, as we embark on a scenic drive from Bozeman to Yellowstone National Park. This journey promises a visual feast of majestic mountains, winding rivers, and the untamed beauty of the American West.  Starting our adventure in Bozeman, known for its vibrant culture and outdoor recreation, we'll set the stage for an incredible road trip. As we leave the town behind, the vast expanse of Montana's big sky country unfolds before us, with the Bridger Mountains to the northeast and the Gallatin Range to the south.  Our first destination is Paradise Valley, a name that perfectly captures the essence of this stunning region. The drive takes us along the Yellowstone River, with its crystal-clear waters reflecting the surrounding peaks. Lush green meadows, dotted with wildflowers, stretch out on either side of the road, creating a picture-perfect scene.   Moving onward, our journey leads us to Livingston, a charming town nestled along the banks of the Yellowstone River. Known for its historic architecture and artistic community, Livingston is a perfect pit stop. Explore the vibrant downtown area, grab a cup of coffee from a local cafe, and soak in the friendly atmosphere.  The town's railroad history is evident in the beautifully preserved Livingston Depot, a must-see for history buffs. Take a stroll along the Yellowstone River Trail for stunning views of the river and the Absaroka Mountains.  We then venture south towards Yellowstone National Park. The landscape becomes more rugged, with the Absaroka Mountains towering on the eastern side of the road. The iconic Roosevelt Arch marks the entrance to the park, and as you pass through, you'll feel the spirit of exploration and wonder that Yellowstone is known for.  Arriving at Mammoth Hot Springs, the geothermal features of Yellowstone take center state. The terraces of travertine formations, created by the flow of hot water over thousands of years, create a surreal and otherworldly landscape. The vibrant colors of the thermophiles add a unique touch to the scenery.   As the day draws to a close, the setting sun casts a warm glow over the landscape, creating a magical atmosphere. The geysers and hot springs take on a different character in the soft light, making for a spectacular end to our journey through Yellowstone.  #Yellowstone #Montana #drivingtour #wyoming #nationalpark #SunsetDrive #8k #HDR #ScenicRoadTrip #freeway  If you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe and I will create more videos like it.

As the wheels turn and the miles pass, I’m reminded that this journey isn’t just about distance—it’s about purpose. Today, I drive to meet some of the most humble yet faith-filled believers, people whose love for God radiates even amidst profound hardship. Although I go to bless them and encourage them, the reality is that I'm the one who receives the greater blessings.  Their hearts are rich with a devotion that inspires our ministry every day. It’s a privilege to carry hope to those who, though poor in material wealth, are immeasurably rich in spirit.  Let this be a reminder to us all: where love for God abounds, no soul is truly impoverished. Together, we are part of something far greater than ourselves - a family united in His name.

This route offers a captivating blend of rugged natural beauty, historic landmarks, and endless open roads, perfect for travelers and adventurers alike.  Starting in Badlands National Park, witness the park’s striking formations, eroded buttes, and vast prairies as we navigate through its winding roads. We’ll then head westward, making our way through South Dakota’s quintessential Great Plains scenery, passing rolling hills, wide-open fields, and small towns that echo the charm of the Midwest.  As we approach the Black Hills, the landscape shifts to towering pines and rocky outcrops. Our final destination is none other than the national monument of Mount Rushmore. Here, the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln stand proudly against the backdrop of the Black Hills, commemorating the legacy of American history.  About the Badlands:  Badlands National Park, located in southwestern South Dakota, is a place of incredible geological and cultural history. Millions of years ago, this region was an ancient seabed, covered by water that gradually receded, leaving behind layers of sediment. Over time, these layers were compressed and transformed into the colorful rock formations we see today. The park’s sharply eroded buttes, pinnacles, and spires were sculpted by wind and water, creating a landscape that appears both timeless and otherworldly.  For thousands of years, Native American tribes, including the Lakota Sioux, called this land home. The name ""badlands"" comes from the Lakota phrase ""mako sica,"" which means ""bad land."" The term reflects the rugged terrain and harsh conditions, which posed challenges for early travelers and settlers. However, the Badlands also served as a place of spiritual and cultural significance, with the Lakota finding shelter, hunting grounds, and sacred sites within the cliffs and canyons.

From Wikipedia: Panama City Beach is a resort town in Bay County, Florida, United States, on the Gulf of Mexico coast. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 12,018. The city is often referred to under the umbrella term of ""Panama City"". Panama City Beach's slogan is ""The World's Most Beautiful Beaches"" due to the unique,[ sugar-white sandy beaches of northwest Florida.  Panama City Beach is a popular vacation destination, especially among people in the Southern United States. The city is also a popular spring break destination, due to its beach and proximity to most of the Southern United States. The first two seasons of MTV’s Floribama Shore were filmed in the city.  A construction boom in the early to mid 2000s changed the image of the area due to the older homes and motels being replaced with high-rise condominiums and more expansive homes. However, this is turning unobstructed, low-rise beach views and affordable waterfront property into rarities. At the peak of the real estate boom, many beachfront properties had quadrupled or more in value since 2000. In November 2006 CNN/Money named Panama City Beach the No. 1 real estate market in America for the next five years in Beachfront property has sold for upwards of $60,000 per ""front foot"" (linear foot) at the top of the market. The downturn in the U.S. real estate market in 2007, combined with a surge of new condo construction, brought spiraling prices somewhat under control. With the real estate boom, Panama City Beach became a well known destination for spring break.  Category 5 Hurricane Michael made landfall near Mexico Beach in Bay County on October 10, 2018, becoming one of the strongest and most-destructive hurricanes in American history as it destroyed a large part of the county, including many structures in Mexico Beach and Panama City. An EF-0 tornado did minor damage to the northwest part of Panama City Beach, Florida on February 15th.Tornadoes of 2021",[],2,03062025

It borders Brazil to the east and south and Suriname to the west.  With a land area of 83,534 km2 (32,253 sq mi),[3] French Guiana is the second-largest region of France (more than one-seventh the size of Metropolitan France) and the largest outermost region within the European Union. It has a very low population density, with only 3.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (9.1/sq mi). (Its population is less than 1⁄200 that of Metropolitan France.) Half of its 294,436 inhabitants in 2022 lived in the metropolitan area of Cayenne, its capital. 98.9% of the land territory of French Guiana is covered by forests,[6] a large part of which is primeval rainforest. The Guiana Amazonian Park, which is the largest national park in the European Union,[7] covers 41% of French Guiana's territory.  Since December 2015, both the region and department have been ruled by a single assembly within the framework of a new territorial collectivity, the French Guiana Territorial Collectivity (French: collectivité territoriale de Guyane). This assembly, the French Guiana Assembly (French: assemblée de Guyane), replaced the former regional council and departmental council, which were disbanded. The French Guiana Assembly is in charge of regional and departmental government. Its president is Gabriel Serville.

A large part of French Guiana's economy depends on jobs and businesses associated with the presence of the Guiana Space Centre, now the European Space Agency's primary launch site near the equator. As elsewhere in France, the official language is standard French, but each ethnic community has its own language, of which French Guianese Creole, a French-based creole language, is the most widely spoken. French Guiana is the only territory on the continental mainland of either North or South America that is under the sovereignty of a European state, much less fully integrated in a European state.  The border between French Guiana and Brazil is the longest land border that France shares with another country, as well as one of only two borders which France shares with non-European states, the other being the border with Suriname in the west.",[],2,03062025

227,ydvsyAZbuSQ,Zion National Park 4K - Scenic Drive - Utah USA,02092020,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,785897,"Saturday evening drive in Zion National Park, the 4th most visited national park in America.  I've wanted to record more national parks for a long time now.  I think 360 video is perfect for this.  Let me know in the comments what you think?  Any other feedback as well, let me know!  Route: https://goo.gl/maps/xoMvmpGaXJJTvTRTA . Zion National Park, one of  6,555 national parks worldwide, is an American national park located in southwestern Utah.  Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches, represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.  A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity.   The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area includes nine formations that together represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation. At various periods in that time warm, shallow seas, streams, ponds and lakes, vast deserts, and dry near-shore environments covered the area. Uplift associated with the creation of the Colorado Plateau lifted the region 10,000 feet (3,000 m) starting 13 million years ago.  Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.  On November 19, 1919, Congress redesignated the monument as Zion National Park, and the act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson. The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate Zion National Monument in 1937, but was incorporated into the national park in 1956.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion_National_Park  A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes, created and protected by national governments. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride.  An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), has defined ""National Park"" as its Category II type of protected areas. According to the IUCN, 6,555 national parks worldwide met its criteria in 2006. IUCN is still discussing the parameters of defining a national park.  While this type of national park had been proposed previously, the United States established the first ""public park for the benefit and enjoyment of the people"", Yellowstone National Park, in 1872. Although Yellowstone was not officially termed a ""national park"" in its establishing law, it was always termed such in practice and is widely held to be the first and oldest national park in the world. However, the Tobago Main Ridge Forest Reserve (established in 1776), and the area surrounding Bogd Khan Uul Mountain (1778) are seen as the oldest legally protected areas, predating Yellowstone by nearly a century.  National parks are almost always open to visitors.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park  https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm",[],2,03062025

This is my drive from Cairo to Alexandria on Agriculture Road. The route is 15 km shorter than the Desert Road, but this route takes an hour more with an ideal drive. The Agriculture Road is definitely worth seeing, but I recommend the Desert Road.  You have to watch out for walking people, taxis, toktok's and especially for (white) microbuses. Their behavior is unpredictable and it can lead to a disaster. Otherwise is driving in Cairo, Egypt a funny and enjoyable thing.

240,BWDIm-rdMi4,Cairo → Suez - The Roads of Egypt 🇪🇬,,UC6p_VrhOJCU-Rirlmb0Sluw,2936,"If you enjoy the video, please like, comment and subscribe, I appreciate it, thank you  Hey folks, driving in Cairo is interesting to watch. It is never boring on the streets of Cairo. For more information subtitles in different languages are available. If you have suggestions or feedback just leave a comment, thank you.   I also permanently displayed the permitted maximum speed. I've heard a lot of complaints about Speeding Tickets. In this way I hope to protect you from possible Speeding tickets. In future videos I will continue this on main roads.  You have to watch out for walking people, taxis, toktok's and especially for (white) microbuses. Their behavior is unpredictable and it can lead to a disaster. Otherwise is driving in Cairo, Egypt a funny and enjoyable thing. Always wear your seat belt and keep to the speed limit.

Тюмень - город, который находится на территории Уральского федерального округа и административный центр Тюменской области. Ближайшие города-миллионники - Екатеринбург (323 км)  и Омск (624 км).🚘  В городе проживает более 800000 человек и город продолжает непрерывно расти. Википедия гласит, что за 2023 год город увеличился на 8130 человек.👀  Места притяжения людей в городе - Мост Влюбленных, историческая часть города и, конечно, горячие источники, их тут аж 20 штук.🏊‍♀️  Город развивается и гастрономически - тут всегда найдётся что поесть, а в последние годы в интернете появилось большое количество обзоров на город от разных блогеров.🥗  🌁Тюмень это:  - пятое место по объему строительства на 2024 год;  - регион рождения известных даже за рубежом - Григория Распутина и самого знаменитого химика в мире Дмитрия Менделеева;  - город, который не так давно входил в состав Омской области;   - первый русский город  Сибири. 😉                                              •••   Basic information about the city.   🌐Tyumen is the administrative center of Tyumen Region. The city is located in the south of Western Siberia, on the banks of the Tura River, 2,200 km away from Moscow. It was Tyumen in 1586 that started Siberia's integration into Russia.   🌁Tyumen is the oil and gas capital of Russia. In the 1960s, major oil deposits were discovered here, and development of the Yugra and Yamal lands began. In record time, large enterprises and modern cities appeared in the midst of the empty and marshy spaces of Siberia. Tyumen soon became the administrative center of the region, managing the oil and gas enterprises.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Тайм-коды/Video Chapters:  00:00 ул.Республики/Respubliki St. 06:35 ул.Профсоюзная/Profsoyuznaya St. 08:35 ул.Даудельная/Daudelnaya St. 10:52 ул.Свердлова/Sverdlova St. 11:34 Музей Словцова (слева)/I.Ya.Slovtsov Museum Complex 11:55 ул.Советская/Sovetskaya St. 13:05 Ресторан ""Сыроварня""(слева)🤤/Restaurant ""Syrovarnya"" 13:15 ЖК 1А Первомайская (справа)/Residential complex ""1A Pervomayskaya 13:34 ул.Первомайская/Pervomayskaya St. 13:50 ул.Сакко/Sakko St. 14:25 ул.Водопроводная/Vodoprovodnaya St. 15:44 Правительство Тюменской области (слева)/Tyumen Region Government 16:46 ул.Республики/Respubliki St. 18:27 пешеходная ул.Дзержинского/Pedestrian street Dzerzhinskogo 20:17 ул.Челюскинцев/Chelyuskintsev St. 20:37 перекрёсток Челюскинцев/Володарского👍/Crossroads of Chelyuskintsev St. and Volodarskogo St. 21:00 ул.Володарского/Volodarskogo St. 22:21 усадьба Колокольниковых (прямо)/Museum-estate of Kolokolnikovy 22:26 ул.Республики/Respubliki St. 22:56 мост Влюбленных (справа)/The Bridge of lovers 23:24 Краеведческий музей Городская Дума/Museum ""City Duma"" 23:40 ул.Ленина/Lenina St. 28:20 ул.Первомайская/Pervomayskaya St. 31:20 ЖД Вокзал/Railway station ""Tyumen""  _____________________________________________  Если вам понравилась Тюмень:  Тюмень - один из самых популярных городов на канале.

It draws about 25,000 tourists per year[1] and is a major La Paz tourist attraction.[2] Many tour operators cater to downhill mountain biking, providing information, guides, transport and equipment. At least 18 cyclists have died on the road since 1998.[1] The tourist route is a 64 km-long road with 3500 metres of descent.[3]  The route includes the Cotapata-Santa Bárbara section. It replaced the old road, built in 1930. It was considered dangerous[1] because of its steep slopes, narrow single track, lack of guardrails, rain, and fog, and was nicknamed the ""Road of Death"". However, it was not the most dangerous road in the region.[4] Unlike the rest of the country, traffic was left-hand, to allow the driver to assess the distance of their outer wheel from the edge of the road.[5]  A new alternative route, now part of Route 3, was built during a 20-year period ending in 2006. The modernization included enlarging the carriageway from one to two lanes; asphalt paving; bridges, drainage, guardrails, and the building of a new section between Chusquipata and Yolosa, bypassing the most dangerous sections of the original road.",[],2,03062025

Está ubicada en la ribera norte —izquierda— del Río de la Plata, a 177 kilómetros de Montevideo y frente a las costas de Buenos Aires, Argentina, de la que dista solo unos 50 kilómetros (en línea recta).  Se encuentra emplazada sobre el cabo que forman las puntas de San Pedro y Santa Rita. Su casco antiguo, el barrio histórico que comprende 12 hectáreas del extremo occidental de la ciudad, fue declarado Patrimonio de la Humanidad en 1995 al ilustrar la fusión exitosa de los estilos portugués, español y poscolonial. El plano es de origen portugués y contrasta con el estándar que prescribía la ley española sobre las Indias Occidentales. Se caracteriza por sus calles angostas de piedra, que resaltan su tradición militar.  Su proximidad con la ciudad de Buenos Aires la vincula fuertemente con esta. Son numerosos los viajeros que llegan y parten con ese destino y también los habitantes de Buenos Aires que tienen propiedades en ella. Existe un proyecto para unir ambas márgenes a través de un puente binacional.

Wine Country, with over 800 wineries, is the region of California, in the northern Bay Area, known worldwide as a premier wine-growing region. The region is famed for its wineries, its cuisine, Michelin star restaurants, boutique hotels, luxury resorts, historic architecture, and culture. Viticulture and wine-making have been practiced in the region since the Spanish missionaries from Mission San Francisco Solano established the first vineyards in 1812.  There are over 800 wineries in the North San Francisco Bay Area, mostly located in the area's valleys, including Napa Valley in Napa County, and the Sonoma Valley, Alexander Valley, Dry Creek Valley, Bennett Valley, and Russian River Valley in Sonoma County. Wine grapes are also grown at higher elevations, such as Atlas Peak and Mount Veeder AVAs. Cities and towns associated with the Wine Country include Santa Rosa, Healdsburg, Sonoma, Kenwood, Petaluma, Sebastopol, Guerneville, Windsor, Geyserville, and Cloverdale in Sonoma County; Napa, Yountville, Rutherford, St. Helena and Calistoga in Napa County; and Hopland and Ukiah in Mendocino County. Wine is also becoming an important part of the economy in nearby Lake and Solano Counties: in 2014, Lake County surpassed Mendocino County in price paid per ton of grapes in the North Coast premium market.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_Country  Napa is the largest city and the second-largest city in California's Wine Country, after Santa Rosa. In 2005, the Napa County wine industry was estimated to be worth in excess of $9.5 billion. Nearly 89% of all United States wine is produced in California, and roughly a third of California wineries are based in Napa County, but only about 4% of California wine is produced in Napa. Once Napa County wine was recognized on the world stage in France, local producers used the newfound reputation to sell wine from the region for a premium over other wines produced elsewhere in California of the same quality. It is because of this reputation that the return on one ton of wine grapes grown in Napa is $3600, while neighboring Sonoma comes in second at $2200 per ton as of 2012.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County_wine  Sonoma County is a county in the U.S. state of California.  Winemaking—both the growing of the grapes and their vinting—is an important part of the economic and cultural life of Sonoma County. In 2004, growers harvested 165,783 short tons (150,396 t)s) of wine grapes worth US$310 million. In 2006 the Sonoma County grape harvest amounted to over 185,000 tons, exceeding Napa County's harvest by over 30 percent. About 80 percent of non-pasture agricultural land in the county is for growing wine grapes—58,280.4 acres (235.852 km2) in 2014 of vineyards, with over 1100 growers. The most common varieties planted are Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot noir, though the area is also known for its Merlot and Zinfandel.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_County,_California  San Francisco, colloquially known as SF, San Fran, Frisco, or The City, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. The north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, is the second most densely populated large U.S. city, and the fifth most densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of the five New York City boroughs. San Francisco is the fourth-largest by economic output, with GDP of $549 billion in 2018.   As of 2020, San Francisco has the highest salaries, disposable income, and median home prices in the world at $1.7 million, as well as the highest median rents. In 2018, San Francisco was the seventh-highest-income county in the United States, with a per capita personal income of $130,696. In the same year, San Francisco proper had a GDP of $183.2 billion, and a GDP per capita of $207,371.  A popular tourist destination, San Francisco is known for its cool summers, fog, steep rolling hills, eclectic mix of architecture, and landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, the former Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, Fisherman's Wharf, and its Chinatown district. San Francisco is also the headquarters of five major banking institutions and various other companies such as Levi Strauss & Co., Gap Inc., Fitbit, Salesforce.com, Dropbox, Reddit, Square, Inc., Dolby, Airbnb, Weebly, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Yelp, Pinterest, Twitter, Uber, Lyft, Mozilla, Wikimedia Foundation and Craigslist.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco",[],2,03062025

The ski resorts here also form largest ski area in the U.S. In all, the resort boasts 17 slopes, 14 bowls, 300 trails and 22 miles of lifts. Route: https://goo.gl/maps/7vX5x2sceSEiW8ny6 . Park City lies east of Salt Lake City in the western state of Utah. Framed by the craggy Wasatch Range, it’s bordered by the Deer Valley Resort and the huge Park City Mountain Resort, both known for their ski slopes. Utah Olympic Park, to the north, hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics and is now predominantly a training facility. In town, Main Street is lined with buildings built during a 19th-century silver mining boom.  https://goo.gl/maps/mPU8HESuSn9MCatG6  https://www.kuer.org/business-economy/2021-01-28/virtual-sundance-film-festival-leaves-park-city-businesses-out-in-the-cold  Park City is a city in Summit County, Utah, United States. The city is 32 miles (51 km) southeast of downtown Salt Lake City.  After a population decline following the shutdown of the area's mining industry, the city rebounded during the 1980s and 1990s through an expansion of its tourism business. The city currently brings in a yearly average of $529.8 million to the Utah Economy as a tourist hot spot, $80 million of which is attributed to the Sundance Film Festival. The city has two major ski resorts: Deer Valley Resort and Park City Mountain Resort. Both ski resorts were the major locations for ski and snowboarding events at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Although they receive less snow and have a shorter ski season than do their counterparts in Salt Lake County, such as Snowbird resort, they are much easier to access.  In 2015, Park City Ski Resort and Canyons resorts merged, creating the largest ski area in the U.S. In all, the resort boasts 17 slopes, 14 bowls, 300 trails and 22 miles of lifts.  The city is the main location of the United States' largest independent film festival, the Sundance Film Festival, home of the United States Ski Team, training center for members of the Australian Freestyle Ski Team, the largest collection of factory outlet stores in northern Utah, the 2002 Olympic bobsled/skeleton/luge track at the Utah Olympic Park, and golf courses. Some scenes from the 1994 film Dumb and Dumber were shot in the city. Outdoor-oriented businesses such as backcountry.com, Rossignol USA, and Skullcandy have their headquarters in Park City. The city has many retailers, clubs, bars, and restaurants, and has nearby reservoirs, hot springs, forests, and hiking and biking trails.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_City,_Utah",[],2,03062025

Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth-most populous city in the United States.  With a census-estimated 2014 population of 2.2 million, it also is the largest city in the Southern United States.    Houston's economy has a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. It is also leading in health care sectors and building oilfield equipment; only New York City is home to more Fortune 500 headquarters within its city limits.[11][12] The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled.[13] Nicknamed the ""Space City"", Houston is a global city, with strengths in business, international trade, entertainment, culture, media, fashion, science, sports, technology, education, medicine, and research. The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds and a large and growing international community. Houston is the most diverse city in Texas and has been described as the most diverse in the United States.[14] It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, which attract more than 7 million visitors a year to the Museum District. Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene in the Theater District and offers year-round resident companies in all major performing arts.  Architecture Houston has the fourth-tallest skyline in North America (after New York City, Chicago, and Toronto) and 12th-tallest in the world, as of 2014.  Economy Houston is recognized worldwide for its energy industry—particularly for oil and natural gas—as well as for biomedical research and aeronautics. Renewable energy sources—wind and solar—are also growing economic bases in the city.[99][100] The Houston Ship Channel is also a large part of Houston's economic base.   The Houston area is a leading center for building oilfield equipment.[103] Much of its success as a petrochemical complex is due to its busy ship channel, the Port of Houston.[104] In the United States, the port ranks first in international commerce and 10th among the largest ports in the world.[13][105] Unlike most places, high oil and gasoline prices are beneficial for Houston's economy, as many of its residents are employed in the energy industry.[106] Houston is the beginning or end point of numerous oil, gas, and products pipelines.  Tourism and Recreation The Theater District is a 17-block area in the center of downtown Houston that is home to the Bayou Place entertainment complex, restaurants, movies, plazas, and parks. Bayou Place is a large multilevel building containing full-service restaurants, bars, live music, billiards, and Sundance Cinema. The Bayou Music Center stages live concerts, stage plays, and stand-up comedy. Space Center Houston is the official visitors' center of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The Space Center has many interactive exhibits including moon rocks, a shuttle simulator, and presentations about the history of NASA's manned space flight program. Other tourist attractions include the Galleria (Texas's largest shopping mall, located in the Uptown District), Old Market Square, the Downtown Aquarium, and Sam Houston Race Park.  Sports Houston has sports teams for every major professional league except the National Hockey League.  The Houston Astros are a Major League Baseball expansion team formed in 1962.  The Houston Rockets are a National Basketball Association franchise based in the city since 1971.  The Houston Texans are a National Football League expansion team formed in 2002.  The Houston Dynamo is a Major League Soccer franchise that has been based in Houston since 2006.  Healthcare Houston is the seat of the internationally renowned Texas Medical Center, which contains the world's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions.[196] All 49 member institutions of the Texas Medical Center are non-profit organizations. They provide patient and preventive care, research, education, and local, national, and international community well-being.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g56003-Activities-Houston_Texas.html  http://www.visithoustontexas.com/  http://www.zillow.com/downtown-houston-tx/",[],2,03062025

We are husband-and-wife architectural/interior photographers based in NYC.

In our videos we will showcase portraits of storefronts and shop owners in New York City & beyond and capture moments of city life that capture the spirit, energy and cultural diversity of individual neighborhoods. We also bring our dog, Hudson along whenever we can.

Our critically acclaimed books include “STORE FRONT: The Disappearing Face of New York”, “New York Nights”, “STORE FRONT II- A History Preserved” and “Broken Windows-Graffiti NYC”.

Video starts in Downtown San Francisco, going south, to Santa Cruz.  The Los Angeles portion of the PCH is more well known but the San Francisco sections, both north and south of the city, are just as beautiful!   Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/G2t7kDHsZpTZ13Uy8 . This route includes the following: SR 1 follows the west coast of the San Francisco Peninsula, passing by the marine mammal colonies at Año Nuevo State Park, and the historic Pigeon Point Lighthouse, before reaching Half Moon Bay. Between Half Moon Bay and Pacifica, the highway bypasses a treacherous stretch known as Devil's Slide via the Tom Lantos Tunnels.    The Pacific Coast Highway State (Route 1 or SR 1) is a major north–south state highway that runs along most of the Pacific coastline of the U.S. state of California. At a total of just over 656 miles (1,056 km), it is the longest state route in California. The highway is designated as an All-American Road. In addition to providing a scenic route to numerous attractions along the coast, the route also serves as a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas.  SR 1 has several portions designated as either Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), Cabrillo Highway, Shoreline Highway, or Coast Highway. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Dana Point in Orange County and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) near Leggett in Mendocino County. SR 1 also at times runs concurrently with US 101, most notably through a 54-mile (87 km) stretch in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and across the Golden Gate Bridge.  SR 1 was built piecemeal in various stages, with the first section opening in the Big Sur region in the 1930s. However, portions of the route had several names and numbers over the years as more segments opened. It was not until the 1964 state highway renumbering that the entire route was officially designated as SR 1. Although SR 1 is a popular route for its scenic beauty, frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused several segments to be either closed for lengthy periods for repairs, or re-routed inland.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1  San Francisco, colloquially known as SF, San Fran, Frisco, or The City, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. The north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, is the second most densely populated large U.S. city, and the fifth most densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of the five New York City boroughs.

Sesimbra is a municipality of Portugal, in the Setúbal District, lying at the foothills of the Serra da Arrábida, a mountain range between Setúbal and Sesimbra. Due to its particular position at the Setúbal Bay, near the mouth of the Sado River and its natural harbour, it is an important fishing town. The population in 2011 was 49,500,[1] in an area of 195.47 km². The present Mayor is Francisco Jesus.  Besides professional fishing and sport fishing (mainly of swordfish), the most significant revenues in Sesimbra come from tourism. The town is known for its beaches, fish restaurants and nightlife.[citation needed]  The original name of Celtic origin was Cempsibriga, meaning the high place (briga) of the Celtic tribe the Cempsi.  Close by, on a mountaintop, 240 m (787.40 ft) above sea level, lies strategically (the ruins of) the Moorish castle. It was taken from the Moors, during the Portuguese Reconquista in the year 1165 by king Afonso Henriques with the help of Frank Crusaders. The battlements afford a panorama over Sesimbra, its harbour and the surrounding countryside. In addition to the castle, Sessimbra has two forts dating back to the 17th century; the Fortress of Saint James of Sesimbra in the centre of town and the Fort of São Teodósio da Ponta do Cavalo. The former contains a museum covering Sesimbra's history as a fishing village.  During the Age of Discoveries, Sesimbra became an important seaport. Even king Manuel I lived here for a while. In the 17th century the fort Fortaleza de Santiago was built along the beach, as part of Portugal's coastal defence. On 3 June 1602 an English fleet defeated a Spanish galley fleet and in addition captured a large Portuguese carrack and severely damaged the fort. It was even used in the 18th century by Portuguese kings as a seaside retreat.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesimbra  Tags: Sesimbra, Portugal, Lisboa, Driving, Driving 4K, Sesimbra Drive, City drive, 4K Drive, Arrábida, Extremadura, Sesimbra 2023, Praia de Sesimbra, Sesimbra beach, Setubal, Praia da fonte da telha, Sintra Beach, Santo Amaro, Santo Amaro Beach, Paço de Arcos, Paço de Arcos Beach, Oeiras Beach, Cascais, Cascais Beach, Cascais, Lisbon Beach, Lisbon Beaches, Oeiras, Portuguese Beaches, Lisboa, Cascais walk, Beach Walk, Lisbon walk, Lisbon 2023, Arrábida 2023, Sesimbra Beach 2023, Sesimbra Summer, summer beaches, summers beaches 2021, Portugal summer 2023, Portugal Beaches, Portugal Beaches 2023, promenade sesimbra, promenade setubal, promenade lisboa, लिस्बन, पुर्तगाल, ポルトガル, リスボン, 포르투갈, 리스본, البرتغال, لشبونة.  ★COPYRIGHT: All the footage was recorded and edited by me.

Route Overview: Our expedition begins in the prestigious town of Pebble Beach, known for its world-renowned golf courses and striking coastal vistas. From the comfort of our vehicle, we capture the lush, manicured landscapes of Pebble Beach as we embark northward. The route is carefully planned to include numerous points of scenic beauty, making this video not just a drive, but a journey through nature's artwork.  As we exit the town, the drive takes us along the scenic 17-Mile Drive, where the ocean meets rugged cliffs peppered with cypress and pine trees. The camera pans smoothly to give viewers a vivid experience of the dramatic coastline and the restless waves crashing against the rocky shores.  As we continue north, the terrain becomes more varied, and the coastal fog occasionally sweeps over the landscape, adding a mysterious veil that enhances the mystical allure of the region. Our cameras are equipped to handle these changes in light and weather, ensuring that every moment is depicted with clarity and depth.  Approaching San Francisco: As we near San Francisco, the urban landscape begins to blend with the natural surroundings. The video captures this transition, highlighting the way the city's architecture interacts with its natural setting. We ensure to film the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge from unique vantage points, offering viewers stunning perspectives of this marvel of engineering.  Golden Hour Finale: The climax of our trip is timed perfectly with the sunset at golden hour, as we cross the Golden Gate Bridge. The entire bridge is bathed in a warm, golden glow, casting long shadows and creating a dreamlike quality that is both serene and spectacular.

This nearly two-hour journey is a visual feast, showcasing the diverse landscapes and changing weather patterns that make Fiji a tropical paradise like no other.  Leaving the luxurious backdrop of the Marriott Resort, the drive unfolds through a lush canvas of greenery that stretches as far as the eye can see. Fiji's natural beauty is on full display, with towering palm trees, vibrant foliage, and the occasional glimpse of the Pacific Ocean setting the stage for an immersive road trip.  As we wind our way through the route, you'll catch glimpses of expansive sugar cane fields, a testament to Fiji's rich agricultural landscape. The vibrant green of the sugar cane contrasts beautifully with the blue skies, creating a picturesque tableau.  However, Fiji's weather is known for its capricious nature, and this drive is no exception. Rain showers come and go, adding a touch of tropical magic to the scenery. Feel the soothing rhythm of raindrops on your virtual windshield as the landscape glistens in the aftermath of a passing shower.  The sun, a constant companion, intermittently breaks through the clouds, casting a golden glow on the surroundings. It's a dance of sunlight and shadow, creating a dynamic interplay of colors and textures.  For copyright reasons, the video is sans audio, but fear not – you're encouraged to curate your own driving soundtrack. Whether it's the rhythmic beats of Fijian tunes, tropical vibes, or your favorite road trip playlist, the choice is yours. Imagine cruising along the Fijian roads with your chosen tunes as the perfect accompaniment to the unfolding beauty outside.  So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the virtual ride from Momi Bay to Ba. Let the lush greenery, sugar cane fields, rain showers, and bursts of sunlight transport you to the heart of Fiji's tropical allure. It's not just a drive; it's a visual symphony of nature, waiting for you to add your soundtrack to the journey.",[],2,03062025

They call a croc to the shore where you can hold its tail and even crouch over it. Just be sure to avoid the head.   These crocs have a spiritual connection with the original founder of Paga and there is a legendary deal brokered that says the humans will not harm the crocodiles and the crocodiles will not harm the humans - or the goats that hang out around the pond.   At night the crocs are likely to be found wandering around the town and they never attack humans. It's a peaceful co-existence.  By the way, there are more than 200 crocs in the pond and only some care to interact with tourists (they're rewarded with fresh fowl). None of them are forced to do anything.

This is a little different from my driving in cities content but I couldn't resist publishing this video.  I'd like to experiment with more infrastructure related videos.  Let me know in the comments if you like it! The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is a fixed link composed of two parallel bridges crossing Lake Pontchartrain in southern Louisiana, United States. The longer of the two bridges is 23.83 miles (38.35 km) long.  The bridges are supported by 9,500 concrete pilings. The two bridges feature a bascule, which spans the navigation channel 8 miles (13 km) south of the north shore.  Since 1969, it was listed by Guinness World Records as the longest bridge over water in the world; in 2011, in response to the opening of the longer Jiaozhou Bay Bridge in China, Guinness World Records created two categories for bridges over water: continuous and aggregate lengths over water. Lake Pontchartrain Causeway then became the longest bridge over water (continuous) while Jiaozhou Bay Bridge the longest bridge over water (aggregate).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Pontchartrain_Causeway  New Orleans is the largest city located in the Gulf Coast region of the southern United States. New Orleans is world-renowned for its french style, distinct music, Creole cuisine, unique dialect, and its annual celebrations and festivals, most notably Mardi Gras. The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter, known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street. The city has been described as the ""most unique"" in the United States, owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage.    Tourism New Orleans has many visitor attractions, from the world-renowned French Quarter to St. Charles Avenue, (home of Tulane and Loyola Universities, the historic Pontchartrain Hotel and many 19th-century mansions) to Magazine Street with its boutique stores and antique shops.  According to current travel guides, New Orleans is one of the top ten most-visited cities in the United States; 10.1 million visitors came to New Orleans in 2004.   A 2009 Travel + Leisure poll of ""America's Favorite Cities"" ranked New Orleans first in ten categories, the most first-place rankings of the 30 cities included. According to the poll, New Orleans was the best U.S. city as a spring break destination and for ""wild weekends"", stylish boutique hotels, cocktail hours, singles/bar scenes, live music/concerts and bands, antique and vintage shops, cafés/coffee bars, neighborhood restaurants, and people watching.  The French Quarter (known locally as ""the Quarter"" or Vieux Carré) contains popular hotels, bars and nightclubs. Notable tourist attractions in the Quarter include Bourbon Street, Jackson Square, St. Louis Cathedral, the French Market (including Café du Monde, famous for café au lait and beignets) and Preservation Hall.   Founded in 1718 by the French, New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States. The city's location and flat elevation have historically made it very vulnerable to flooding. State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans",[],2,03062025

The border between Tennessee and North Carolina runs northeast to southwest through the centerline of the park. It is the most visited national park in the United States.  Attractions and Activities The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a major tourist attraction in the region. Over 9 million tourists and 11 million non-recreational visitors traveled to the park in 2010, more than twice as many visitors as the Grand Canyon, the second most visited national park.[15] Surrounding towns, notably Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Townsend, Tennessee, and Cherokee, Sylva, Maggie Valley, and Bryson City, North Carolina receive a significant portion of their income from tourism associated with the park. The two main visitors' centers inside the park are Sugarlands Visitors' Center near the Gatlinburg entrance to the park and Oconaluftee Visitor Center near Cherokee, North Carolina at the eastern entrance to the park. These ranger stations provide exhibits on wildlife, geology, and the history of the park. They also sell books, maps, and souvenirs. Unlike most other national parks, there is no entry fee to the park.  The park has a number of historical attractions. The most well-preserved of these (and most popular) is Cades Cove, a valley with a number of preserved historic buildings including log cabins, barns, and churches. Cades Cove is the single most frequented destination in the national park. Self-guided automobile and bicycle tours offer the many sightseers a glimpse into the way of life of old-time southern Appalachia. Other historical areas within the park include Roaring Fork, Cataloochee, Elkmont, and the Mountain Farm Museum and Mingus Mill at Oconaluftee.  Historic districts • Cades Cove Historic District • Elkmont Historic District • Oconaluftee Archaeological District • Noah Ogle Place • Roaring Fork Historic District Individual listings Hannah Cabin in Little Cataloochee, was built in the mid-1800s by John Jackson Hannah, the son of early pioneer Evan Hannah.

This is the must do scenic drive in Los Angeles when you visit California!  Video starts in Santa Monica on Ocean Boulevard, continues along the Pacific Coast Highway through Malibu, and ends at Point Mugu State Park.  Enjoy! Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/fJZZGfkk6XgeSaaX8 . The Pacific Coast Highway State (Route 1 or SR 1) is a major north–south state highway that runs along most of the Pacific coastline of the U.S. state of California. At a total of just over 656 miles (1,056 km), it is the longest state route in California. The highway is designated as an All-American Road. In addition to providing a scenic route to numerous attractions along the coast, the route also serves as a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas.  SR 1 has several portions designated as either Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), Cabrillo Highway, Shoreline Highway, or Coast Highway. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Dana Point in Orange County and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) near Leggett in Mendocino County. SR 1 also at times runs concurrently with US 101, most notably through a 54-mile (87 km) stretch in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and across the Golden Gate Bridge.  SR 1 was built piecemeal in various stages, with the first section opening in the Big Sur region in the 1930s. However, portions of the route had several names and numbers over the years as more segments opened. It was not until the 1964 state highway renumbering that the entire route was officially designated as SR 1. Although SR 1 is a popular route for its scenic beauty, frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused several segments to be either closed for lengthy periods for repairs, or re-routed inland.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1  Los Angeles, often known by its initials L.A., is known for its Mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, Hollywood entertainment industry, sprawling metropolis and its $1.0 trillion economy.

Napa County, once the producer of many different crops, is known today for its regional wine industry, rising to the first rank of wine regions with France by local wineries Stag's Leap Wine Cellars and Chateau Montelena winning the ""Judgment of Paris"" in 1976.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California  Napa Valley is an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located in Napa County, California.  Napa Valley is considered one of the premier wine regions in the world. Records of commercial wine production in the region date back to the nineteenth century, but premium wine production dates back only to the 1960s.[4]  The combination of Mediterranean climate, geography and geology of the region are conducive to growing quality wine grapes. John Patchett established the Napa Valley's first commercial vineyard in 1858.[6] In 1861 Charles Krug established another of Napa Valley's first commercial wineries in St. Helena.[6] Viticulture in Napa suffered several setbacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including an outbreak of the vine disease phylloxera, the institution of Prohibition, and the Great Depression. The wine industry in Napa Valley recovered, and helped by the results of the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, came to be seen as capable of producing the best quality wine – equal to that of Old World wine regions. Napa Valley is now a major enotourism destination.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_Valley_AVA  YouTube https://www.youtube.com/@jutah Instagram https://www.instagram.com/j_utah99/ Twitter https://twitter.com/jutah99",[],2,03062025

This journey takes us through the scenic landscapes of New England and down the East Coast, navigating a mix of city skylines, suburban sprawls, and the open highway.  History of Boston and New York   • Founding: Boston was established in 1630 by Puritan settlers, while New York, initially called New Amsterdam, was founded by the Dutch in 1624. When the British took control of New Amsterdam in 1664, renaming it New York, the city began to compete more directly with Boston, which was already an important center of Puritan culture and commerce.  • Religious and Cultural Differences: Boston was deeply rooted in Puritan values, while New York, due to its Dutch origins, was more religiously and culturally diverse. This set the stage for the distinct identities that each city would carry into the modern era.  If you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe and I will create more videos like it.

At the end of the last ice age, humans began inhabiting the mountain range. After explorations of the range by Europeans, natural resources such as mineral and fur drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains, although the range itself never experienced a dense population.  Of the 100 highest peaks in the Rocky Mountains, 78 (including the 30 highest) are located in Colorado, ten in Wyoming, six in New Mexico, three in Montana, and one in Utah. Public parks and forest lands protect much of the mountain range, and they are popular tourist destinations, especially for hiking, camping, mountaineering, fishing, hunting, mountain biking, skiing, and snowboarding.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains",[],2,03062025

The larger urban area surrounding the city, known as Antananarivo-Renivohitra (""Antananarivo-Mother Hill"" or ""Antananarivo-Capital""), is the capital of Analamanga region. The city sits at 1,280 m (4,199 ft) above sea level in the center of the island, the highest national capital by elevation among the island countries. It has been the country's largest population center since at least the 18th century. The presidency, National Assembly, Senate and Supreme Court are located there, as are 21 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of many national and international businesses and NGOs. It has more universities, nightclubs, art venues, and medical services than any city on the island. Several national and local sports teams, including the championship-winning national rugby team, the Makis are based here.  Antananarivo was historically the capital of the Merina people, who continue to form the majority of the city's estimated 1,300,000 (2013) inhabitants. The surrounding urban areas have a total metropolitan population approaching three million. All 18 Malagasy ethnic groups, as well as residents of Chinese, Indian, European and other origins, are represented in the city. It was founded circa 1610, when the Merina King Andrianjaka (1612–1630) expelled the Vazimba inhabitants of the village of Analamanga. Declaring it the site of his capital, Andrianjaka built a rova (fortified royal dwelling) that expanded to become the royal palaces of the Kingdom of Imerina. The city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710), who renamed it Antananarivo (""City of the Thousand"") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers.  The city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Imerina until 1710, when Imerina split into four warring quadrants. Antananarivo became the capital of the southern quadrant until 1794, when King Andrianampoinimerina of Ambohimanga captured the province and restored it as capital of a united Kingdom of Imerina, also bringing neighboring ethnic groups under Merina control. These conquests continued under his son, Radama I, who eventually controlled over two-thirds of the island, leading him to be considered the King of Madagascar by European diplomats. Antananarivo remained the island's capital after Madagascar was colonized by the French in 1897, and after independence in 1960.  The city is now managed by the Commune Urbaine d'Antananarivo (CUA) under the direction of its President of the Special Delegation, Ny Havana Andriamanjato, appointed in March 2014. Limited funds and mismanagement have hampered consecutive CUA efforts to manage overcrowding and traffic, waste management, pollution, security, public water and electricity, and other challenges linked to explosive population growth. Major historic landmarks and attractions in the city include the reconstructed royal palaces and the Andafiavaratra Palace, the tomb of Rainiharo, Tsimbazaza Zoo, Mahamasina Stadium, Lake Anosy, four 19th-century martyr cathedrals, and the Museum of Art and Archaeology.

SUBSCRIBE IF YOU ❤️. 🎥 Recorded on Saturday, January, 11, 2020  📍 Maps: https://goo.gl/maps/H5bTUU2rPD3dqNuDA 📸 Visit Antananarivo (in french): https://www.tourisme-antananarivo.com/index.php/fr/ ✈ Air Madagascar: https://www.airmadagascar.com/en  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antananarivo Antananarivo, also known by its colonial shorthand form Tana, is the capital and largest city of Madagascar. The larger urban area surrounding the city, known as Antananarivo-Renivohitra (""Antananarivo-Mother Hill"" or ""Antananarivo-Capital""), is the capital of Analamanga region. The city sits at 1,280 m (4,199 ft) above sea level in the center of the island, the highest national capital by elevation among the island countries. It has been the country's largest population center since at least the 18th century. The presidency, National Assembly, Senate and Supreme Court are located there, as are 21 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of many national and international businesses and NGOs. It has more universities, nightclubs, art venues, and medical services than any city on the island. Several national and local sports teams, including the championship-winning national rugby team, the Makis are based here.  Antananarivo was historically the capital of the Merina people, who continue to form the majority of the city's estimated 1,300,000 (2013) inhabitants. The surrounding urban areas have a total metropolitan population approaching three million. All 18 Malagasy ethnic groups, as well as residents of Chinese, Indian, European and other origins, are represented in the city. It was founded circa 1610, when the Merina King Andrianjaka (1612–1630) expelled the Vazimba inhabitants of the village of Analamanga. Declaring it the site of his capital, Andrianjaka built a rova (fortified royal dwelling) that expanded to become the royal palaces of the Kingdom of Imerina. The city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710), who renamed it Antananarivo (""City of the Thousand"") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers.  The city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Imerina until 1710, when Imerina split into four warring quadrants. Antananarivo became the capital of the southern quadrant until 1794, when King Andrianampoinimerina of Ambohimanga captured the province and restored it as capital of a united Kingdom of Imerina, also bringing neighboring ethnic groups under Merina control. These conquests continued under his son, Radama I, who eventually controlled over two-thirds of the island, leading him to be considered the King of Madagascar by European diplomats. Antananarivo remained the island's capital after Madagascar was colonized by the French in 1897, and after independence in 1960.  The city is now managed by the Commune Urbaine d'Antananarivo (CUA) under the direction of its President of the Special Delegation, Ny Havana Andriamanjato, appointed in March 2014. Limited funds and mismanagement have hampered consecutive CUA efforts to manage overcrowding and traffic, waste management, pollution, security, public water and electricity, and other challenges linked to explosive population growth. Major historic landmarks and attractions in the city include the reconstructed royal palaces and the Andafiavaratra Palace, the tomb of Rainiharo, Tsimbazaza Zoo, Mahamasina Stadium, Lake Anosy, four 19th-century martyr cathedrals, and the Museum of Art and Archaeology.
