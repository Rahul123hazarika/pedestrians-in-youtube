5,7NSGFFb_YJs,Italian Riviera 4K - Yachts & Seaside Resorts - Scenic Drive,10072021,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,375745,"Afternoon drive along the Italian Riviera, from the major seaport city of Genoa (Genova) to the picturesque harbour of Portofino.  Parking for YOUR Superyatch at Portofino is only $75,000 per month! ;) Yachts, cliffs, beaches, colorfully painted resorts, amazing Italian culture, along the Italian coastline.  I love Italian cities (I want to get an electric car or a motorcycle so I can ride in the ZTL) but the coastline is another level! Lots of American popular culture over the past 30 years focused Italy.  And the Italian coastline is a great representation of what makes Italy so great!  Hopefully this video helps until you get to visit in person! Starting Point:  https://goo.gl/maps/foicj9yXZ5biSgmF9 . The Italian Riviera.  As a tourist centre, the Italian Riviera benefits from over 300 days of sunshine per year, and is known for its beaches, colourfully painted towns, natural environment, food, and luxury villas and hotels, as well as for its popular resort facilities, major yachting and cruising areas with several marinas, festivals, golf courses, sailing, rock climbing and scenic views of centuries old farmhouses and cottages.  The Italian Riviera, or Ligurian Riviera, is the narrow coastal strip in Italy which lies between the Ligurian Sea and the mountain chain formed by the Maritime Alps and the Apennines. Longitudinally it extends from the border with France and the French Riviera (or Côte d'Azur) near Ventimiglia (a former customs post) eastwards to Capo Corvo (also known as Punta Bianca) which marks the eastern end of the Gulf of La Spezia and is close to the regional border between Liguria and Tuscany.   The mild climate draws an active tourist trade in the numerous coastal resorts, which include Alassio, Bonassola, Bordighera, Camogli, Cinque Terre, Lerici, Levanto, Noli, Portofino, Porto Venere, Santa Margherita Ligure, Sanremo, San Fruttuoso, and Sestri Levante. It is also known for its historical association with international celebrity and artistic visitors; writers and poets like Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Ezra Pound, and Ernest Hemingway were inspired by the beauty and spirit of the region.  Industries are concentrated in and around Genoa, Savona, and along the shores of the Gulf of La Spezia. Genoa and La Spezia are Italy’s leading shipyards; La Spezia is Italy’s major naval base, and Savona is a major centre of the Italian iron industry. Chemical, textile, and food industries are also important.  A number of streets and palaces in the center of Genoa and the Cinque Terre National Park (which includes Cinque Terre, Portovenere, and the islands Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto) are two of Italy's 55 World Heritage Sites.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Riviera  Genoa is the capital of the Italian region of Liguria and the sixth-largest city in Italy.  Genoa has historically been one of the most important ports on the Mediterranean: it is currently the busiest in Italy and in the Mediterranean Sea and twelfth-busiest in the European Union.  Genoa was the capital of one of the most powerful maritime republics for over seven centuries, from the 11th century to 1797. Particularly from the 12th century to the 15th century, the city played a leading role in the commercial trade in Europe, becoming one of the largest naval powers of the continent and considered among the wealthiest cities in the world.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa  Portofino (Portofin) is an Italian fishing village and holiday resort famous for its picturesque harbour and historical association with celebrity and artistic visitors. It is a comune located in the Metropolitan City of Genoa on the Italian Riviera. The town is clustered around its small harbour, and is known for the colourfully painted buildings that line the shore.  In Popular Culture: - In 1959 Dalida released song ""Love in Portofino"", written by Leo Chiosso and composed by Fred Buscaglione. With lyrics in French and Italian language, it became a hit and was later iconised alongside the village's name. It also spawned several international covers, including Andrea Bocelli's in 2013 which was followed by a concert recorded and issued on DVD. - Portofino is the eponym of Frank Schaeffer's Portofino: A Novel (1992). It was the first of Schaeffer's Calvin Becker Trilogy. - There is a full-scale replica, in authentic detail, of Portofino Bay at Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, USA, which opened in September 1999. - Portofino inspired in 2001 a recreation of the seaside town in the Mediterranean Harbor area at Tokyo Disney Sea in Chiba, Japan. It also served as the namesake for the restaurant Cafe Portofino. - Portofino was featured in 2008 in the television series Top Gear (Episode 5, Series 12). Richard Hammond, in a Ferrari Daytona raced James May in a carbon fibre powerboat from Portofino to St Tropez in France. - Ferrari named one of their new V8 sports cars after Portofino in 2017.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portofino",[],11,3062025

Given its size it was not hard to explore this tiny nation, so I recorded a full circuit of this island which took just 22 minutes. I hope you enjoy it!  ✈️ About me:  My name is Mark and I am from the UK.  In 2022 I sold my business after fifteen years of hard work and very few holidays. I immediately set out to make sure I enjoyed a well-earned ‘midlife crisis’. As I am too fat to fit in a Porsche, I settled quickly instead on going to the places I have dreamt of visiting, in airplane seats that I can fit in.

Let me know how it looks on your display please! Route: https://goo.gl/maps/J3gAMe5v1Wm3SDWk7 . Dorset is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast.  Dorset has a varied landscape featuring broad elevated chalk downs, steep limestone ridges and low-lying clay valleys. Over half the county is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Three-quarters of its coastline is part of the Jurassic Coast Natural World Heritage Site due to its geological and palaeontologic significance. It features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove, the Isle of Portland, Chesil Beach and Durdle Door. Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has become increasingly important to the economy. There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of A roads cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London. Dorset has ports at Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and an international airport near Bournemouth. The county has a variety of museums, theatres and festivals, and is host to the Great Dorset Steam Fair, one of the biggest events of its kind in Europe. It is the birthplace of Thomas Hardy, who used the county as the principal setting of his novels, and William Barnes, whose poetry celebrates the ancient Dorset dialect.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset  The Jurassic Coast is a World Heritage Site on the English Channel coast of southern England. It stretches from Exmouth in East Devon to Studland Bay in Dorset, a distance of about 96 miles (154 km), and was inscribed on the World Heritage List in mid-December 2001.  The site spans 185 million years of geological history, coastal erosion having exposed an almost continuous sequence of rock formation covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. At different times, this area has been desert, shallow tropical sea and marsh, and the fossilised remains of the various creatures that lived here have been preserved in the rocks.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Coast  https://www.dorsetaonb.org.uk/",[],8,3062025

The largest corral reef on the U.S. mainland.  One of my favorite places in the world!  I hope you enjoy! Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/z69nAvqkF4G9XPL27 . The Florida Keys are a coral cay archipelago located off the southern coast of Florida, forming the southernmost part of the continental United States. The area is popular for fishing and tourism, including ecotourism, with many visitors scuba diving in the area's protected waters.  The northern and central sections of the Florida Keys are the exposed portions of an ancient coral reef, the Key Largo Limestone.  They begin at the southeastern coast of the Florida peninsula, about 15 miles (24 km) south of Miami, and extend in a gentle arc south-southwest and then westward to Key West, the westernmost of the inhabited islands, and on to the uninhabited Dry Tortugas. The islands lie along the Florida Straits, dividing the Atlantic Ocean to the east from the Gulf of Mexico to the northwest, and defining one edge of Florida Bay. At the nearest point, the southern part of Key West is just 90 miles (140 km) from Cuba. The Florida Keys are between about 24.3 and 25.5 degrees North latitude.  The Overseas Highway is a 113-mile (181.9 km) highway carrying U.S. Route 1 (US 1) through the Florida Keys to Key West. Large parts of it were built on the former right-of-way of the Overseas Railroad, the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway. Completed in 1912, the Overseas Railroad was heavily damaged and partially destroyed in the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. The Florida East Coast Railway was financially unable to rebuild the destroyed sections, so the roadbed and remaining bridges were sold to the state of Florida for $640,000.  Since the 1950s the Overseas Highway has been refurbished into a main coastal highway between the cities of Miami and Key West, offering travelers an exotic roadway through a tropical savanna environment and access to the largest area of coral reefs on the U.S. mainland. Many exotic animals such as the American Alligator, American Crocodile and Key Deer inhabit the tropical islands of the Florida Keys.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Keys  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Highway",[],5,3062025

The Coast Road is a 7.3 kilometre stretch of road that is part of a major European Union transport corridor,  known as the TransEuropean Network for Transport (TEN-T).  The road has been widened and road alignments have been made to improve road safety. The road, which was previously  associated with fatal and grievous accidents, was upgraded to a two-lane dual carriage way with physical separation  between traffic travelling in each direction. The new road has made it easier to reach the northern side of Malta  from the centre of the island and has reduced journey times.

Andorra fun facts:  1. Andorra is the 16th smallest country in the world by land and the 11th smallest by population. It is only about a 40km drive from one side of the country to the other side. The total population of Andorra is only about 77,000 citizens and residents.   2. Andorra is the world’s only co-principality. A principality is a place ruled by a prince. Monaco is an example of a principality. Andorra, however, is a co-principality. They have two princes who jointly share the title of prince. Surprisingly, neither of the two princes are from Andorra. One prince is the President of France, Emmanuel Macron. The other co-prince is the Bishop of Urgell, who is currently Joan Enric Vives Sicília. The position is a constitutional one similar to the British Monarchy and holds no real power.  3. Andorra is the only country in the world with Catalan as its official language.  4. Andorra has never been in a war in almost 1,000 years. Given its non-strategic location in the Pyrenees Mountains and lack of natural resources, Andorra has been without conflict almost since Charlemagne came through to fight the Moors. Technically, Andorra did declare war on Germany in WWI, but it never sent anyone into the conflict. Given Andorra’s lack of participation in WWI, they were forgotten about in the Treaty of Versailles and didn’t officially declare peace with Germany until 1957!  5. Andorra has no national bank and has never had its own currency. Andorra currently uses the Euro as its currency. Before that, it primarily used the Spanish Peseta and sometimes the French Franc. There is no national bank in Andorra, so it has to use private banks if the country wants to incur debt.  6. Andorra is not part of the EU, EFTA, or the Eurozone. Andorra is not a member of most of the major European associations. Even though it uses the Euro, the country is not technically part of the Eurozone. It has a special relationship with the EU in which it follows the trade rules for the industry, but not for agriculture. It’s also not a party to the Schengen Treaty, however, you can only access Andorra via Spain and France, which are party to the treaty. And since Andorra doesn’t have an airport, it’s de facto subject to the agreement.  7. Andorra la Vella is the highest capital city in Europe. At an elevation of 1,023 meters (3356 feet), there is no higher elevation capital in all of Europe. In fact, it’s the 10th highest city of any kind in Europe and boasts a population of over 10,000.  8. Andorra has the most tourists per capita in the world. With over 10,000,000 visitors per year and a population of only 77,000, Andorra has the most visitors in the world per capita. The vast majority of the visitors to Andorra are Spanish and French citizens who go there to shop and purchase fuel at cheaper prices.  Enjoyed the video?

It shares borders with Argentina to its west and southwest and Brazil to its north and northeast; while bordering the Río de la Plata to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. It is part of the Southern Cone region of South America. Uruguay covers an area of approximately 181,034 square kilometers (69,898 sq mi) and has a population of an estimated 3.51 million, of whom 2 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. The area that became Uruguay was first inhabited by groups of hunter–gatherers 13,000 years ago. The predominant tribe at the moment of the arrival of Europeans was the Charrúa people, when the Portuguese first established Colónia do Sacramento in 1680; Uruguay was colonized by Europeans late relative to neighboring countries. The Spanish founded Montevideo as a military stronghold in the early 18th century because of the competing claims over the region. Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828, following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain, and later Argentina and Brazil. It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century, with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics. A series of economic crises and the political repression against left-wing guerrilla activity in the late 1960s and early 1970s put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century.

Sheep, stone walls, small villages, quiet streams, and stunning scenic countryside views!  Video begins in the small village of Penrhyndeudraeth, passes through Beddgelert, over Pen-y-Pass of Caernarfon, and ends in the village of Llanberis.  Unlike National Parks in America, you will find many residents within National Parks throughout the UK (more than 26,000 people live within Snowdonia National Park).  Filmed in 4K60FPS HDR H.265 and 4K30FPS SDR H.264.  This video is the H.265 version.  Please let me know if the video plays correctly on your display!   Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/w2i5tT6NCXMY2Q9e6 . Snowdonia is a region in northwest Wales concentrated around the mountains and glacial landforms of massive Snowdonia National Park. The park's historic Snowdon Mountain Railway climbs to the summit of Wales's highest mountain, Mount Snowdon, offering views across the sea to Ireland. The park is also home to an extensive network of trails, over 100 lakes and craggy peaks like Cader Idris and Tryfan. ― Google  Snowdonia (Welsh: Eryri) is a mountainous region in northwestern Wales and a national park of 823 square miles (2,130 km2) in area. It was the first to be designated of the three national parks in Wales, in 1951.  Snowdonia National Park (Welsh: Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri) was established in 1951 as the third national park in Britain, following the Peak District and the Lake District. It covers 827 square miles (2,140 km2), and has 37 miles (60 km) of coastline. The Snowdonia National Park covers parts of the counties of Gwynedd and Conwy.  The park is governed by the Snowdonia National Park Authority, which is made up of local government and Welsh Government representatives, and its main offices are at Penrhyndeudraeth. Unlike national parks in other countries, Snowdonia (and other such parks in Britain) is made up of both public and private lands under central planning authority.  More than 26,000 people live within the park. 58.6% of the population could speak Welsh in 2011.  While most of the land is either open or mountainous land, there is a significant amount of agricultural activity within the park.  Since the local government re-organisation of 1998, the park lies partly in the county of Gwynedd, and partly in the county borough of Conwy. It is governed by the 18-member Snowdonia National Park Authority; nine members are appointed by Gwynedd, 3 by Conwy, and the remaining six by the Welsh Government to represent the national interest. Unusually, Snowdonia National Park has a hole in the middle, around the town of Blaenau Ffestiniog, a slate quarrying centre. This was deliberately excluded from the park when it was set up to allow the development of new light industry to replace the reduced slate industry. (There is a similar situation in the Peak District National Park where the boundaries were drawn to exclude large built-up areas and industrial sites from the park with the town of Buxton and the adjacent quarries outside but surrounded on three sides by the park.) The Snowdonia Society is a registered charity formed in 1967. It is a voluntary group of people with an interest in the area and its protection.  Amory Lovins led the successful 1970s opposition to stop Rio Tinto digging up the area for a massive mine.  Climate Snowdonia is one of the wettest parts of the United Kingdom; Crib Goch in Snowdonia is the wettest spot in the United Kingdom, with an average rainfall of 4,473 millimetres (176.1 in) a year over the 30-year period prior to the mid-2000s. (There is a rainfall gauge at 713 metres, 2340' on the slopes below Crib Goch.)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdonia",[],3,03062025

With nearly twice as many tourists as the Grand Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United States with over 11.3 million recreational visitors in 2016. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is an American national park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site that straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The border between Tennessee and North Carolina runs northeast to southwest through the centerline of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Maine to Georgia. The park was chartered by the United States Congress in 1934 and officially dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.  The park encompasses 522,419 acres (816.28 sq mi; 211,415.47 ha; 2,114.15 km2), making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States. The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) at the towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and Cherokee, North Carolina. Great Smoky Mountains was the first national park whose land and other costs were paid for in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smoky_Mountains_National_Park",[],3,03062025

110,fZqP89ro0ro,Napa Valley 4K - California Vineyards - Scenic Drive,,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,206734,"Sunday afternoon drive through Napa Valley near San Francisco California along the popular Silverado Trail.  This area is the premier wine region of the USA and home to over 800 wineries.  The video starts in downtown Napa, continues along the Silverado Trail to Calistoga, and back towards downtown Napa.   Route: https://goo.gl/maps/KMf9qb5sq6TjGbfSA . Napa Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Napa County in California's Wine Country. Napa Valley is considered one of the premier wine regions in the world. Records of commercial wine production in the region date back to the nineteenth century, but premium wine production dates back only to the 1960s.  The combination of Mediterranean climate, geography and geology of the region are conducive to growing quality wine grapes. John Patchett established the Napa Valley's first commercial vineyard in 1858. In 1861 Charles Krug established another of Napa Valley's first commercial wineries in St. Helena. Viticulture in Napa suffered several setbacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including an outbreak of the vine disease phylloxera, the institution of Prohibition, and the Great Depression. The wine industry in Napa Valley recovered, and helped by the results of the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, came to be seen as capable of producing the best quality wine – equal to that of Old World wine regions. Napa Valley is now a major enotourism destination.  Napa Valley as a top wine region In 1976, the region got a boost from the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, which featured a Napa Valley Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon besting several famous French labels in a blind tasting format. The story of the wine competition, termed the ""Judgment of Paris"", was made into a Hollywood movie in 2008, called Bottle Shock. The results of this tasting cemented the region's reputation as a producer of world class wines.  A trend of larger national and international companies like E & J Gallo Winery, Diageo and Constellation Brands buying smaller wineries, vineyards and brands began to gain momentum in the early part of the 21st century. Today Napa Valley features more than 450 wineries that grow grape varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Merlot, Zinfandel, among others. While winemakers may produce wines from specific AVAs within the valley, many wines are made as a blend from grapes grown on the valley floor and the surrounding hillsides.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_Valley_AVA  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_Country  https://www.napavalley.com/guides/silverado-trail-wineries/  https://www.visitcalifornia.com/experience/napa-valleys-silverado-trail  https://www.wines.com/blog/the-silverado-trail/",[],3,03062025

The Rocky Mountains stretch 3,000 mi (4,800 km) in straight-line distance from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico in the Southwestern United States.   At the end of the last ice age, humans began inhabiting the mountain range. After explorations of the range by Europeans, natural resources such as mineral and fur drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains, although the range itself never experienced a dense population.  Of the 100 highest peaks in the Rocky Mountains, 78 (including the 30 highest) are located in Colorado, ten in Wyoming, six in New Mexico, three in Montana, and one in Utah. Public parks and forest lands protect much of the mountain range, and they are popular tourist destinations, especially for hiking, camping, mountaineering, fishing, hunting, mountain biking, skiing, and snowboarding.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains",[],3,03062025

143,SDibyW9WJl4,Driving Yellowstone in 8K HDR Dolby Vision - Bozeman Montana to Yellowstone National Park,,UCX_uGzVgYJuo_iuYSBqEr4g,380545,"Enjoy this 2.5 hour  road trip through the breathtaking landscapes of Montana, as we embark on a scenic drive from Bozeman to Yellowstone National Park. This journey promises a visual feast of majestic mountains, winding rivers, and the untamed beauty of the American West.  Starting our adventure in Bozeman, known for its vibrant culture and outdoor recreation, we'll set the stage for an incredible road trip. As we leave the town behind, the vast expanse of Montana's big sky country unfolds before us, with the Bridger Mountains to the northeast and the Gallatin Range to the south.  Our first destination is Paradise Valley, a name that perfectly captures the essence of this stunning region. The drive takes us along the Yellowstone River, with its crystal-clear waters reflecting the surrounding peaks. Lush green meadows, dotted with wildflowers, stretch out on either side of the road, creating a picture-perfect scene.   Moving onward, our journey leads us to Livingston, a charming town nestled along the banks of the Yellowstone River. Known for its historic architecture and artistic community, Livingston is a perfect pit stop. Explore the vibrant downtown area, grab a cup of coffee from a local cafe, and soak in the friendly atmosphere.  The town's railroad history is evident in the beautifully preserved Livingston Depot, a must-see for history buffs. Take a stroll along the Yellowstone River Trail for stunning views of the river and the Absaroka Mountains.  We then venture south towards Yellowstone National Park. The landscape becomes more rugged, with the Absaroka Mountains towering on the eastern side of the road. The iconic Roosevelt Arch marks the entrance to the park, and as you pass through, you'll feel the spirit of exploration and wonder that Yellowstone is known for.  Arriving at Mammoth Hot Springs, the geothermal features of Yellowstone take center state. The terraces of travertine formations, created by the flow of hot water over thousands of years, create a surreal and otherworldly landscape. The vibrant colors of the thermophiles add a unique touch to the scenery.   As the day draws to a close, the setting sun casts a warm glow over the landscape, creating a magical atmosphere. The geysers and hot springs take on a different character in the soft light, making for a spectacular end to our journey through Yellowstone.  #Yellowstone #Montana #drivingtour #wyoming #nationalpark #SunsetDrive #8k #HDR #ScenicRoadTrip #freeway  If you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe and I will create more videos like it.

As the wheels turn and the miles pass, I’m reminded that this journey isn’t just about distance—it’s about purpose. Today, I drive to meet some of the most humble yet faith-filled believers, people whose love for God radiates even amidst profound hardship. Although I go to bless them and encourage them, the reality is that I'm the one who receives the greater blessings.  Their hearts are rich with a devotion that inspires our ministry every day. It’s a privilege to carry hope to those who, though poor in material wealth, are immeasurably rich in spirit.  Let this be a reminder to us all: where love for God abounds, no soul is truly impoverished. Together, we are part of something far greater than ourselves - a family united in His name.

This route offers a captivating blend of rugged natural beauty, historic landmarks, and endless open roads, perfect for travelers and adventurers alike.  Starting in Badlands National Park, witness the park’s striking formations, eroded buttes, and vast prairies as we navigate through its winding roads. We’ll then head westward, making our way through South Dakota’s quintessential Great Plains scenery, passing rolling hills, wide-open fields, and small towns that echo the charm of the Midwest.  As we approach the Black Hills, the landscape shifts to towering pines and rocky outcrops. Our final destination is none other than the national monument of Mount Rushmore. Here, the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln stand proudly against the backdrop of the Black Hills, commemorating the legacy of American history.  About the Badlands:  Badlands National Park, located in southwestern South Dakota, is a place of incredible geological and cultural history. Millions of years ago, this region was an ancient seabed, covered by water that gradually receded, leaving behind layers of sediment. Over time, these layers were compressed and transformed into the colorful rock formations we see today. The park’s sharply eroded buttes, pinnacles, and spires were sculpted by wind and water, creating a landscape that appears both timeless and otherworldly.  For thousands of years, Native American tribes, including the Lakota Sioux, called this land home. The name ""badlands"" comes from the Lakota phrase ""mako sica,"" which means ""bad land."" The term reflects the rugged terrain and harsh conditions, which posed challenges for early travelers and settlers. However, the Badlands also served as a place of spiritual and cultural significance, with the Lakota finding shelter, hunting grounds, and sacred sites within the cliffs and canyons.

From Wikipedia: Panama City Beach is a resort town in Bay County, Florida, United States, on the Gulf of Mexico coast. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 12,018. The city is often referred to under the umbrella term of ""Panama City"". Panama City Beach's slogan is ""The World's Most Beautiful Beaches"" due to the unique,[ sugar-white sandy beaches of northwest Florida.  Panama City Beach is a popular vacation destination, especially among people in the Southern United States. The city is also a popular spring break destination, due to its beach and proximity to most of the Southern United States. The first two seasons of MTV’s Floribama Shore were filmed in the city.  A construction boom in the early to mid 2000s changed the image of the area due to the older homes and motels being replaced with high-rise condominiums and more expansive homes. However, this is turning unobstructed, low-rise beach views and affordable waterfront property into rarities. At the peak of the real estate boom, many beachfront properties had quadrupled or more in value since 2000. In November 2006 CNN/Money named Panama City Beach the No. 1 real estate market in America for the next five years in Beachfront property has sold for upwards of $60,000 per ""front foot"" (linear foot) at the top of the market. The downturn in the U.S. real estate market in 2007, combined with a surge of new condo construction, brought spiraling prices somewhat under control. With the real estate boom, Panama City Beach became a well known destination for spring break.  Category 5 Hurricane Michael made landfall near Mexico Beach in Bay County on October 10, 2018, becoming one of the strongest and most-destructive hurricanes in American history as it destroyed a large part of the county, including many structures in Mexico Beach and Panama City. An EF-0 tornado did minor damage to the northwest part of Panama City Beach, Florida on February 15th.Tornadoes of 2021",[],2,03062025

It borders Brazil to the east and south and Suriname to the west.  With a land area of 83,534 km2 (32,253 sq mi),[3] French Guiana is the second-largest region of France (more than one-seventh the size of Metropolitan France) and the largest outermost region within the European Union. It has a very low population density, with only 3.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (9.1/sq mi). (Its population is less than 1⁄200 that of Metropolitan France.) Half of its 294,436 inhabitants in 2022 lived in the metropolitan area of Cayenne, its capital. 98.9% of the land territory of French Guiana is covered by forests,[6] a large part of which is primeval rainforest. The Guiana Amazonian Park, which is the largest national park in the European Union,[7] covers 41% of French Guiana's territory.  Since December 2015, both the region and department have been ruled by a single assembly within the framework of a new territorial collectivity, the French Guiana Territorial Collectivity (French: collectivité territoriale de Guyane). This assembly, the French Guiana Assembly (French: assemblée de Guyane), replaced the former regional council and departmental council, which were disbanded. The French Guiana Assembly is in charge of regional and departmental government. Its president is Gabriel Serville.

A large part of French Guiana's economy depends on jobs and businesses associated with the presence of the Guiana Space Centre, now the European Space Agency's primary launch site near the equator. As elsewhere in France, the official language is standard French, but each ethnic community has its own language, of which French Guianese Creole, a French-based creole language, is the most widely spoken. French Guiana is the only territory on the continental mainland of either North or South America that is under the sovereignty of a European state, much less fully integrated in a European state.  The border between French Guiana and Brazil is the longest land border that France shares with another country, as well as one of only two borders which France shares with non-European states, the other being the border with Suriname in the west.",[],2,03062025

227,ydvsyAZbuSQ,Zion National Park 4K - Scenic Drive - Utah USA,02092020,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,785897,"Saturday evening drive in Zion National Park, the 4th most visited national park in America.  I've wanted to record more national parks for a long time now.  I think 360 video is perfect for this.  Let me know in the comments what you think?  Any other feedback as well, let me know!  Route: https://goo.gl/maps/xoMvmpGaXJJTvTRTA . Zion National Park, one of  6,555 national parks worldwide, is an American national park located in southwestern Utah.  Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches, represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.  A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity.   The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area includes nine formations that together represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation. At various periods in that time warm, shallow seas, streams, ponds and lakes, vast deserts, and dry near-shore environments covered the area. Uplift associated with the creation of the Colorado Plateau lifted the region 10,000 feet (3,000 m) starting 13 million years ago.  Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.  On November 19, 1919, Congress redesignated the monument as Zion National Park, and the act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson. The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate Zion National Monument in 1937, but was incorporated into the national park in 1956.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion_National_Park  A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes, created and protected by national governments. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride.  An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), has defined ""National Park"" as its Category II type of protected areas. According to the IUCN, 6,555 national parks worldwide met its criteria in 2006. IUCN is still discussing the parameters of defining a national park.  While this type of national park had been proposed previously, the United States established the first ""public park for the benefit and enjoyment of the people"", Yellowstone National Park, in 1872. Although Yellowstone was not officially termed a ""national park"" in its establishing law, it was always termed such in practice and is widely held to be the first and oldest national park in the world. However, the Tobago Main Ridge Forest Reserve (established in 1776), and the area surrounding Bogd Khan Uul Mountain (1778) are seen as the oldest legally protected areas, predating Yellowstone by nearly a century.  National parks are almost always open to visitors.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park  https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm",[],2,03062025

This is my drive from Cairo to Alexandria on Agriculture Road. The route is 15 km shorter than the Desert Road, but this route takes an hour more with an ideal drive. The Agriculture Road is definitely worth seeing, but I recommend the Desert Road.  You have to watch out for walking people, taxis, toktok's and especially for (white) microbuses. Their behavior is unpredictable and it can lead to a disaster. Otherwise is driving in Cairo, Egypt a funny and enjoyable thing.

240,BWDIm-rdMi4,Cairo → Suez - The Roads of Egypt 🇪🇬,,UC6p_VrhOJCU-Rirlmb0Sluw,2936,"If you enjoy the video, please like, comment and subscribe, I appreciate it, thank you  Hey folks, driving in Cairo is interesting to watch. It is never boring on the streets of Cairo. For more information subtitles in different languages are available. If you have suggestions or feedback just leave a comment, thank you.   I also permanently displayed the permitted maximum speed. I've heard a lot of complaints about Speeding Tickets. In this way I hope to protect you from possible Speeding tickets. In future videos I will continue this on main roads.  You have to watch out for walking people, taxis, toktok's and especially for (white) microbuses. Their behavior is unpredictable and it can lead to a disaster. Otherwise is driving in Cairo, Egypt a funny and enjoyable thing. Always wear your seat belt and keep to the speed limit.

Тюмень - город, который находится на территории Уральского федерального округа и административный центр Тюменской области. Ближайшие города-миллионники - Екатеринбург (323 км)  и Омск (624 км).🚘  В городе проживает более 800000 человек и город продолжает непрерывно расти. Википедия гласит, что за 2023 год город увеличился на 8130 человек.👀  Места притяжения людей в городе - Мост Влюбленных, историческая часть города и, конечно, горячие источники, их тут аж 20 штук.🏊‍♀️  Город развивается и гастрономически - тут всегда найдётся что поесть, а в последние годы в интернете появилось большое количество обзоров на город от разных блогеров.🥗  🌁Тюмень это:  - пятое место по объему строительства на 2024 год;  - регион рождения известных даже за рубежом - Григория Распутина и самого знаменитого химика в мире Дмитрия Менделеева;  - город, который не так давно входил в состав Омской области;   - первый русский город  Сибири. 😉                                              •••   Basic information about the city.   🌐Tyumen is the administrative center of Tyumen Region. The city is located in the south of Western Siberia, on the banks of the Tura River, 2,200 km away from Moscow. It was Tyumen in 1586 that started Siberia's integration into Russia.   🌁Tyumen is the oil and gas capital of Russia. In the 1960s, major oil deposits were discovered here, and development of the Yugra and Yamal lands began. In record time, large enterprises and modern cities appeared in the midst of the empty and marshy spaces of Siberia. Tyumen soon became the administrative center of the region, managing the oil and gas enterprises.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Тайм-коды/Video Chapters:  00:00 ул.Республики/Respubliki St. 06:35 ул.Профсоюзная/Profsoyuznaya St. 08:35 ул.Даудельная/Daudelnaya St. 10:52 ул.Свердлова/Sverdlova St. 11:34 Музей Словцова (слева)/I.Ya.Slovtsov Museum Complex 11:55 ул.Советская/Sovetskaya St. 13:05 Ресторан ""Сыроварня""(слева)🤤/Restaurant ""Syrovarnya"" 13:15 ЖК 1А Первомайская (справа)/Residential complex ""1A Pervomayskaya 13:34 ул.Первомайская/Pervomayskaya St. 13:50 ул.Сакко/Sakko St. 14:25 ул.Водопроводная/Vodoprovodnaya St. 15:44 Правительство Тюменской области (слева)/Tyumen Region Government 16:46 ул.Республики/Respubliki St. 18:27 пешеходная ул.Дзержинского/Pedestrian street Dzerzhinskogo 20:17 ул.Челюскинцев/Chelyuskintsev St. 20:37 перекрёсток Челюскинцев/Володарского👍/Crossroads of Chelyuskintsev St. and Volodarskogo St. 21:00 ул.Володарского/Volodarskogo St. 22:21 усадьба Колокольниковых (прямо)/Museum-estate of Kolokolnikovy 22:26 ул.Республики/Respubliki St. 22:56 мост Влюбленных (справа)/The Bridge of lovers 23:24 Краеведческий музей Городская Дума/Museum ""City Duma"" 23:40 ул.Ленина/Lenina St. 28:20 ул.Первомайская/Pervomayskaya St. 31:20 ЖД Вокзал/Railway station ""Tyumen""  _____________________________________________  Если вам понравилась Тюмень:  Тюмень - один из самых популярных городов на канале.

It draws about 25,000 tourists per year[1] and is a major La Paz tourist attraction.[2] Many tour operators cater to downhill mountain biking, providing information, guides, transport and equipment. At least 18 cyclists have died on the road since 1998.[1] The tourist route is a 64 km-long road with 3500 metres of descent.[3]  The route includes the Cotapata-Santa Bárbara section. It replaced the old road, built in 1930. It was considered dangerous[1] because of its steep slopes, narrow single track, lack of guardrails, rain, and fog, and was nicknamed the ""Road of Death"". However, it was not the most dangerous road in the region.[4] Unlike the rest of the country, traffic was left-hand, to allow the driver to assess the distance of their outer wheel from the edge of the road.[5]  A new alternative route, now part of Route 3, was built during a 20-year period ending in 2006. The modernization included enlarging the carriageway from one to two lanes; asphalt paving; bridges, drainage, guardrails, and the building of a new section between Chusquipata and Yolosa, bypassing the most dangerous sections of the original road.",[],2,03062025

Está ubicada en la ribera norte —izquierda— del Río de la Plata, a 177 kilómetros de Montevideo y frente a las costas de Buenos Aires, Argentina, de la que dista solo unos 50 kilómetros (en línea recta).  Se encuentra emplazada sobre el cabo que forman las puntas de San Pedro y Santa Rita. Su casco antiguo, el barrio histórico que comprende 12 hectáreas del extremo occidental de la ciudad, fue declarado Patrimonio de la Humanidad en 1995 al ilustrar la fusión exitosa de los estilos portugués, español y poscolonial. El plano es de origen portugués y contrasta con el estándar que prescribía la ley española sobre las Indias Occidentales. Se caracteriza por sus calles angostas de piedra, que resaltan su tradición militar.  Su proximidad con la ciudad de Buenos Aires la vincula fuertemente con esta. Son numerosos los viajeros que llegan y parten con ese destino y también los habitantes de Buenos Aires que tienen propiedades en ella. Existe un proyecto para unir ambas márgenes a través de un puente binacional.

Wine Country, with over 800 wineries, is the region of California, in the northern Bay Area, known worldwide as a premier wine-growing region. The region is famed for its wineries, its cuisine, Michelin star restaurants, boutique hotels, luxury resorts, historic architecture, and culture. Viticulture and wine-making have been practiced in the region since the Spanish missionaries from Mission San Francisco Solano established the first vineyards in 1812.  There are over 800 wineries in the North San Francisco Bay Area, mostly located in the area's valleys, including Napa Valley in Napa County, and the Sonoma Valley, Alexander Valley, Dry Creek Valley, Bennett Valley, and Russian River Valley in Sonoma County. Wine grapes are also grown at higher elevations, such as Atlas Peak and Mount Veeder AVAs. Cities and towns associated with the Wine Country include Santa Rosa, Healdsburg, Sonoma, Kenwood, Petaluma, Sebastopol, Guerneville, Windsor, Geyserville, and Cloverdale in Sonoma County; Napa, Yountville, Rutherford, St. Helena and Calistoga in Napa County; and Hopland and Ukiah in Mendocino County. Wine is also becoming an important part of the economy in nearby Lake and Solano Counties: in 2014, Lake County surpassed Mendocino County in price paid per ton of grapes in the North Coast premium market.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_Country  Napa is the largest city and the second-largest city in California's Wine Country, after Santa Rosa. In 2005, the Napa County wine industry was estimated to be worth in excess of $9.5 billion. Nearly 89% of all United States wine is produced in California, and roughly a third of California wineries are based in Napa County, but only about 4% of California wine is produced in Napa. Once Napa County wine was recognized on the world stage in France, local producers used the newfound reputation to sell wine from the region for a premium over other wines produced elsewhere in California of the same quality. It is because of this reputation that the return on one ton of wine grapes grown in Napa is $3600, while neighboring Sonoma comes in second at $2200 per ton as of 2012.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County_wine  Sonoma County is a county in the U.S. state of California.  Winemaking—both the growing of the grapes and their vinting—is an important part of the economic and cultural life of Sonoma County. In 2004, growers harvested 165,783 short tons (150,396 t)s) of wine grapes worth US$310 million. In 2006 the Sonoma County grape harvest amounted to over 185,000 tons, exceeding Napa County's harvest by over 30 percent. About 80 percent of non-pasture agricultural land in the county is for growing wine grapes—58,280.4 acres (235.852 km2) in 2014 of vineyards, with over 1100 growers. The most common varieties planted are Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot noir, though the area is also known for its Merlot and Zinfandel.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_County,_California  San Francisco, colloquially known as SF, San Fran, Frisco, or The City, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. The north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, is the second most densely populated large U.S. city, and the fifth most densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of the five New York City boroughs. San Francisco is the fourth-largest by economic output, with GDP of $549 billion in 2018.   As of 2020, San Francisco has the highest salaries, disposable income, and median home prices in the world at $1.7 million, as well as the highest median rents. In 2018, San Francisco was the seventh-highest-income county in the United States, with a per capita personal income of $130,696. In the same year, San Francisco proper had a GDP of $183.2 billion, and a GDP per capita of $207,371.  A popular tourist destination, San Francisco is known for its cool summers, fog, steep rolling hills, eclectic mix of architecture, and landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, the former Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, Fisherman's Wharf, and its Chinatown district. San Francisco is also the headquarters of five major banking institutions and various other companies such as Levi Strauss & Co., Gap Inc., Fitbit, Salesforce.com, Dropbox, Reddit, Square, Inc., Dolby, Airbnb, Weebly, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Yelp, Pinterest, Twitter, Uber, Lyft, Mozilla, Wikimedia Foundation and Craigslist.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco",[],2,03062025

The ski resorts here also form largest ski area in the U.S. In all, the resort boasts 17 slopes, 14 bowls, 300 trails and 22 miles of lifts. Route: https://goo.gl/maps/7vX5x2sceSEiW8ny6 . Park City lies east of Salt Lake City in the western state of Utah. Framed by the craggy Wasatch Range, it’s bordered by the Deer Valley Resort and the huge Park City Mountain Resort, both known for their ski slopes. Utah Olympic Park, to the north, hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics and is now predominantly a training facility. In town, Main Street is lined with buildings built during a 19th-century silver mining boom.  https://goo.gl/maps/mPU8HESuSn9MCatG6  https://www.kuer.org/business-economy/2021-01-28/virtual-sundance-film-festival-leaves-park-city-businesses-out-in-the-cold  Park City is a city in Summit County, Utah, United States. The city is 32 miles (51 km) southeast of downtown Salt Lake City.  After a population decline following the shutdown of the area's mining industry, the city rebounded during the 1980s and 1990s through an expansion of its tourism business. The city currently brings in a yearly average of $529.8 million to the Utah Economy as a tourist hot spot, $80 million of which is attributed to the Sundance Film Festival. The city has two major ski resorts: Deer Valley Resort and Park City Mountain Resort. Both ski resorts were the major locations for ski and snowboarding events at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Although they receive less snow and have a shorter ski season than do their counterparts in Salt Lake County, such as Snowbird resort, they are much easier to access.  In 2015, Park City Ski Resort and Canyons resorts merged, creating the largest ski area in the U.S. In all, the resort boasts 17 slopes, 14 bowls, 300 trails and 22 miles of lifts.  The city is the main location of the United States' largest independent film festival, the Sundance Film Festival, home of the United States Ski Team, training center for members of the Australian Freestyle Ski Team, the largest collection of factory outlet stores in northern Utah, the 2002 Olympic bobsled/skeleton/luge track at the Utah Olympic Park, and golf courses. Some scenes from the 1994 film Dumb and Dumber were shot in the city. Outdoor-oriented businesses such as backcountry.com, Rossignol USA, and Skullcandy have their headquarters in Park City. The city has many retailers, clubs, bars, and restaurants, and has nearby reservoirs, hot springs, forests, and hiking and biking trails.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_City,_Utah",[],2,03062025

Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth-most populous city in the United States.  With a census-estimated 2014 population of 2.2 million, it also is the largest city in the Southern United States.    Houston's economy has a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. It is also leading in health care sectors and building oilfield equipment; only New York City is home to more Fortune 500 headquarters within its city limits.[11][12] The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled.[13] Nicknamed the ""Space City"", Houston is a global city, with strengths in business, international trade, entertainment, culture, media, fashion, science, sports, technology, education, medicine, and research. The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds and a large and growing international community. Houston is the most diverse city in Texas and has been described as the most diverse in the United States.[14] It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, which attract more than 7 million visitors a year to the Museum District. Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene in the Theater District and offers year-round resident companies in all major performing arts.  Architecture Houston has the fourth-tallest skyline in North America (after New York City, Chicago, and Toronto) and 12th-tallest in the world, as of 2014.  Economy Houston is recognized worldwide for its energy industry—particularly for oil and natural gas—as well as for biomedical research and aeronautics. Renewable energy sources—wind and solar—are also growing economic bases in the city.[99][100] The Houston Ship Channel is also a large part of Houston's economic base.   The Houston area is a leading center for building oilfield equipment.[103] Much of its success as a petrochemical complex is due to its busy ship channel, the Port of Houston.[104] In the United States, the port ranks first in international commerce and 10th among the largest ports in the world.[13][105] Unlike most places, high oil and gasoline prices are beneficial for Houston's economy, as many of its residents are employed in the energy industry.[106] Houston is the beginning or end point of numerous oil, gas, and products pipelines.  Tourism and Recreation The Theater District is a 17-block area in the center of downtown Houston that is home to the Bayou Place entertainment complex, restaurants, movies, plazas, and parks. Bayou Place is a large multilevel building containing full-service restaurants, bars, live music, billiards, and Sundance Cinema. The Bayou Music Center stages live concerts, stage plays, and stand-up comedy. Space Center Houston is the official visitors' center of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The Space Center has many interactive exhibits including moon rocks, a shuttle simulator, and presentations about the history of NASA's manned space flight program. Other tourist attractions include the Galleria (Texas's largest shopping mall, located in the Uptown District), Old Market Square, the Downtown Aquarium, and Sam Houston Race Park.  Sports Houston has sports teams for every major professional league except the National Hockey League.  The Houston Astros are a Major League Baseball expansion team formed in 1962.  The Houston Rockets are a National Basketball Association franchise based in the city since 1971.  The Houston Texans are a National Football League expansion team formed in 2002.  The Houston Dynamo is a Major League Soccer franchise that has been based in Houston since 2006.  Healthcare Houston is the seat of the internationally renowned Texas Medical Center, which contains the world's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions.[196] All 49 member institutions of the Texas Medical Center are non-profit organizations. They provide patient and preventive care, research, education, and local, national, and international community well-being.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g56003-Activities-Houston_Texas.html  http://www.visithoustontexas.com/  http://www.zillow.com/downtown-houston-tx/",[],2,03062025

We are husband-and-wife architectural/interior photographers based in NYC.

In our videos we will showcase portraits of storefronts and shop owners in New York City & beyond and capture moments of city life that capture the spirit, energy and cultural diversity of individual neighborhoods. We also bring our dog, Hudson along whenever we can.

Our critically acclaimed books include “STORE FRONT: The Disappearing Face of New York”, “New York Nights”, “STORE FRONT II- A History Preserved” and “Broken Windows-Graffiti NYC”.

Video starts in Downtown San Francisco, going south, to Santa Cruz.  The Los Angeles portion of the PCH is more well known but the San Francisco sections, both north and south of the city, are just as beautiful!   Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/G2t7kDHsZpTZ13Uy8 . This route includes the following: SR 1 follows the west coast of the San Francisco Peninsula, passing by the marine mammal colonies at Año Nuevo State Park, and the historic Pigeon Point Lighthouse, before reaching Half Moon Bay. Between Half Moon Bay and Pacifica, the highway bypasses a treacherous stretch known as Devil's Slide via the Tom Lantos Tunnels.    The Pacific Coast Highway State (Route 1 or SR 1) is a major north–south state highway that runs along most of the Pacific coastline of the U.S. state of California. At a total of just over 656 miles (1,056 km), it is the longest state route in California. The highway is designated as an All-American Road. In addition to providing a scenic route to numerous attractions along the coast, the route also serves as a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas.  SR 1 has several portions designated as either Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), Cabrillo Highway, Shoreline Highway, or Coast Highway. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Dana Point in Orange County and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) near Leggett in Mendocino County. SR 1 also at times runs concurrently with US 101, most notably through a 54-mile (87 km) stretch in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and across the Golden Gate Bridge.  SR 1 was built piecemeal in various stages, with the first section opening in the Big Sur region in the 1930s. However, portions of the route had several names and numbers over the years as more segments opened. It was not until the 1964 state highway renumbering that the entire route was officially designated as SR 1. Although SR 1 is a popular route for its scenic beauty, frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused several segments to be either closed for lengthy periods for repairs, or re-routed inland.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1  San Francisco, colloquially known as SF, San Fran, Frisco, or The City, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. The north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, is the second most densely populated large U.S. city, and the fifth most densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of the five New York City boroughs.

Sesimbra is a municipality of Portugal, in the Setúbal District, lying at the foothills of the Serra da Arrábida, a mountain range between Setúbal and Sesimbra. Due to its particular position at the Setúbal Bay, near the mouth of the Sado River and its natural harbour, it is an important fishing town. The population in 2011 was 49,500,[1] in an area of 195.47 km². The present Mayor is Francisco Jesus.  Besides professional fishing and sport fishing (mainly of swordfish), the most significant revenues in Sesimbra come from tourism. The town is known for its beaches, fish restaurants and nightlife.[citation needed]  The original name of Celtic origin was Cempsibriga, meaning the high place (briga) of the Celtic tribe the Cempsi.  Close by, on a mountaintop, 240 m (787.40 ft) above sea level, lies strategically (the ruins of) the Moorish castle. It was taken from the Moors, during the Portuguese Reconquista in the year 1165 by king Afonso Henriques with the help of Frank Crusaders. The battlements afford a panorama over Sesimbra, its harbour and the surrounding countryside. In addition to the castle, Sessimbra has two forts dating back to the 17th century; the Fortress of Saint James of Sesimbra in the centre of town and the Fort of São Teodósio da Ponta do Cavalo. The former contains a museum covering Sesimbra's history as a fishing village.  During the Age of Discoveries, Sesimbra became an important seaport. Even king Manuel I lived here for a while. In the 17th century the fort Fortaleza de Santiago was built along the beach, as part of Portugal's coastal defence. On 3 June 1602 an English fleet defeated a Spanish galley fleet and in addition captured a large Portuguese carrack and severely damaged the fort. It was even used in the 18th century by Portuguese kings as a seaside retreat.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesimbra  Tags: Sesimbra, Portugal, Lisboa, Driving, Driving 4K, Sesimbra Drive, City drive, 4K Drive, Arrábida, Extremadura, Sesimbra 2023, Praia de Sesimbra, Sesimbra beach, Setubal, Praia da fonte da telha, Sintra Beach, Santo Amaro, Santo Amaro Beach, Paço de Arcos, Paço de Arcos Beach, Oeiras Beach, Cascais, Cascais Beach, Cascais, Lisbon Beach, Lisbon Beaches, Oeiras, Portuguese Beaches, Lisboa, Cascais walk, Beach Walk, Lisbon walk, Lisbon 2023, Arrábida 2023, Sesimbra Beach 2023, Sesimbra Summer, summer beaches, summers beaches 2021, Portugal summer 2023, Portugal Beaches, Portugal Beaches 2023, promenade sesimbra, promenade setubal, promenade lisboa, लिस्बन, पुर्तगाल, ポルトガル, リスボン, 포르투갈, 리스본, البرتغال, لشبونة.  ★COPYRIGHT: All the footage was recorded and edited by me.

Route Overview: Our expedition begins in the prestigious town of Pebble Beach, known for its world-renowned golf courses and striking coastal vistas. From the comfort of our vehicle, we capture the lush, manicured landscapes of Pebble Beach as we embark northward. The route is carefully planned to include numerous points of scenic beauty, making this video not just a drive, but a journey through nature's artwork.  As we exit the town, the drive takes us along the scenic 17-Mile Drive, where the ocean meets rugged cliffs peppered with cypress and pine trees. The camera pans smoothly to give viewers a vivid experience of the dramatic coastline and the restless waves crashing against the rocky shores.  As we continue north, the terrain becomes more varied, and the coastal fog occasionally sweeps over the landscape, adding a mysterious veil that enhances the mystical allure of the region. Our cameras are equipped to handle these changes in light and weather, ensuring that every moment is depicted with clarity and depth.  Approaching San Francisco: As we near San Francisco, the urban landscape begins to blend with the natural surroundings. The video captures this transition, highlighting the way the city's architecture interacts with its natural setting. We ensure to film the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge from unique vantage points, offering viewers stunning perspectives of this marvel of engineering.  Golden Hour Finale: The climax of our trip is timed perfectly with the sunset at golden hour, as we cross the Golden Gate Bridge. The entire bridge is bathed in a warm, golden glow, casting long shadows and creating a dreamlike quality that is both serene and spectacular.

This nearly two-hour journey is a visual feast, showcasing the diverse landscapes and changing weather patterns that make Fiji a tropical paradise like no other.  Leaving the luxurious backdrop of the Marriott Resort, the drive unfolds through a lush canvas of greenery that stretches as far as the eye can see. Fiji's natural beauty is on full display, with towering palm trees, vibrant foliage, and the occasional glimpse of the Pacific Ocean setting the stage for an immersive road trip.  As we wind our way through the route, you'll catch glimpses of expansive sugar cane fields, a testament to Fiji's rich agricultural landscape. The vibrant green of the sugar cane contrasts beautifully with the blue skies, creating a picturesque tableau.  However, Fiji's weather is known for its capricious nature, and this drive is no exception. Rain showers come and go, adding a touch of tropical magic to the scenery. Feel the soothing rhythm of raindrops on your virtual windshield as the landscape glistens in the aftermath of a passing shower.  The sun, a constant companion, intermittently breaks through the clouds, casting a golden glow on the surroundings. It's a dance of sunlight and shadow, creating a dynamic interplay of colors and textures.  For copyright reasons, the video is sans audio, but fear not – you're encouraged to curate your own driving soundtrack. Whether it's the rhythmic beats of Fijian tunes, tropical vibes, or your favorite road trip playlist, the choice is yours. Imagine cruising along the Fijian roads with your chosen tunes as the perfect accompaniment to the unfolding beauty outside.  So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the virtual ride from Momi Bay to Ba. Let the lush greenery, sugar cane fields, rain showers, and bursts of sunlight transport you to the heart of Fiji's tropical allure. It's not just a drive; it's a visual symphony of nature, waiting for you to add your soundtrack to the journey.",[],2,03062025

They call a croc to the shore where you can hold its tail and even crouch over it. Just be sure to avoid the head.   These crocs have a spiritual connection with the original founder of Paga and there is a legendary deal brokered that says the humans will not harm the crocodiles and the crocodiles will not harm the humans - or the goats that hang out around the pond.   At night the crocs are likely to be found wandering around the town and they never attack humans. It's a peaceful co-existence.  By the way, there are more than 200 crocs in the pond and only some care to interact with tourists (they're rewarded with fresh fowl). None of them are forced to do anything.

This is a little different from my driving in cities content but I couldn't resist publishing this video.  I'd like to experiment with more infrastructure related videos.  Let me know in the comments if you like it! The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is a fixed link composed of two parallel bridges crossing Lake Pontchartrain in southern Louisiana, United States. The longer of the two bridges is 23.83 miles (38.35 km) long.  The bridges are supported by 9,500 concrete pilings. The two bridges feature a bascule, which spans the navigation channel 8 miles (13 km) south of the north shore.  Since 1969, it was listed by Guinness World Records as the longest bridge over water in the world; in 2011, in response to the opening of the longer Jiaozhou Bay Bridge in China, Guinness World Records created two categories for bridges over water: continuous and aggregate lengths over water. Lake Pontchartrain Causeway then became the longest bridge over water (continuous) while Jiaozhou Bay Bridge the longest bridge over water (aggregate).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Pontchartrain_Causeway  New Orleans is the largest city located in the Gulf Coast region of the southern United States. New Orleans is world-renowned for its french style, distinct music, Creole cuisine, unique dialect, and its annual celebrations and festivals, most notably Mardi Gras. The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter, known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street. The city has been described as the ""most unique"" in the United States, owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage.    Tourism New Orleans has many visitor attractions, from the world-renowned French Quarter to St. Charles Avenue, (home of Tulane and Loyola Universities, the historic Pontchartrain Hotel and many 19th-century mansions) to Magazine Street with its boutique stores and antique shops.  According to current travel guides, New Orleans is one of the top ten most-visited cities in the United States; 10.1 million visitors came to New Orleans in 2004.   A 2009 Travel + Leisure poll of ""America's Favorite Cities"" ranked New Orleans first in ten categories, the most first-place rankings of the 30 cities included. According to the poll, New Orleans was the best U.S. city as a spring break destination and for ""wild weekends"", stylish boutique hotels, cocktail hours, singles/bar scenes, live music/concerts and bands, antique and vintage shops, cafés/coffee bars, neighborhood restaurants, and people watching.  The French Quarter (known locally as ""the Quarter"" or Vieux Carré) contains popular hotels, bars and nightclubs. Notable tourist attractions in the Quarter include Bourbon Street, Jackson Square, St. Louis Cathedral, the French Market (including Café du Monde, famous for café au lait and beignets) and Preservation Hall.   Founded in 1718 by the French, New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States. The city's location and flat elevation have historically made it very vulnerable to flooding. State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans",[],2,03062025

The border between Tennessee and North Carolina runs northeast to southwest through the centerline of the park. It is the most visited national park in the United States.  Attractions and Activities The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a major tourist attraction in the region. Over 9 million tourists and 11 million non-recreational visitors traveled to the park in 2010, more than twice as many visitors as the Grand Canyon, the second most visited national park.[15] Surrounding towns, notably Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Townsend, Tennessee, and Cherokee, Sylva, Maggie Valley, and Bryson City, North Carolina receive a significant portion of their income from tourism associated with the park. The two main visitors' centers inside the park are Sugarlands Visitors' Center near the Gatlinburg entrance to the park and Oconaluftee Visitor Center near Cherokee, North Carolina at the eastern entrance to the park. These ranger stations provide exhibits on wildlife, geology, and the history of the park. They also sell books, maps, and souvenirs. Unlike most other national parks, there is no entry fee to the park.  The park has a number of historical attractions. The most well-preserved of these (and most popular) is Cades Cove, a valley with a number of preserved historic buildings including log cabins, barns, and churches. Cades Cove is the single most frequented destination in the national park. Self-guided automobile and bicycle tours offer the many sightseers a glimpse into the way of life of old-time southern Appalachia. Other historical areas within the park include Roaring Fork, Cataloochee, Elkmont, and the Mountain Farm Museum and Mingus Mill at Oconaluftee.  Historic districts • Cades Cove Historic District • Elkmont Historic District • Oconaluftee Archaeological District • Noah Ogle Place • Roaring Fork Historic District Individual listings Hannah Cabin in Little Cataloochee, was built in the mid-1800s by John Jackson Hannah, the son of early pioneer Evan Hannah.

This is the must do scenic drive in Los Angeles when you visit California!  Video starts in Santa Monica on Ocean Boulevard, continues along the Pacific Coast Highway through Malibu, and ends at Point Mugu State Park.  Enjoy! Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/fJZZGfkk6XgeSaaX8 . The Pacific Coast Highway State (Route 1 or SR 1) is a major north–south state highway that runs along most of the Pacific coastline of the U.S. state of California. At a total of just over 656 miles (1,056 km), it is the longest state route in California. The highway is designated as an All-American Road. In addition to providing a scenic route to numerous attractions along the coast, the route also serves as a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas.  SR 1 has several portions designated as either Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), Cabrillo Highway, Shoreline Highway, or Coast Highway. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Dana Point in Orange County and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) near Leggett in Mendocino County. SR 1 also at times runs concurrently with US 101, most notably through a 54-mile (87 km) stretch in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and across the Golden Gate Bridge.  SR 1 was built piecemeal in various stages, with the first section opening in the Big Sur region in the 1930s. However, portions of the route had several names and numbers over the years as more segments opened. It was not until the 1964 state highway renumbering that the entire route was officially designated as SR 1. Although SR 1 is a popular route for its scenic beauty, frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused several segments to be either closed for lengthy periods for repairs, or re-routed inland.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1  Los Angeles, often known by its initials L.A., is known for its Mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, Hollywood entertainment industry, sprawling metropolis and its $1.0 trillion economy.

Napa County, once the producer of many different crops, is known today for its regional wine industry, rising to the first rank of wine regions with France by local wineries Stag's Leap Wine Cellars and Chateau Montelena winning the ""Judgment of Paris"" in 1976.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California  Napa Valley is an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located in Napa County, California.  Napa Valley is considered one of the premier wine regions in the world. Records of commercial wine production in the region date back to the nineteenth century, but premium wine production dates back only to the 1960s.[4]  The combination of Mediterranean climate, geography and geology of the region are conducive to growing quality wine grapes. John Patchett established the Napa Valley's first commercial vineyard in 1858.[6] In 1861 Charles Krug established another of Napa Valley's first commercial wineries in St. Helena.[6] Viticulture in Napa suffered several setbacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including an outbreak of the vine disease phylloxera, the institution of Prohibition, and the Great Depression. The wine industry in Napa Valley recovered, and helped by the results of the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, came to be seen as capable of producing the best quality wine – equal to that of Old World wine regions. Napa Valley is now a major enotourism destination.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_Valley_AVA  YouTube https://www.youtube.com/@jutah Instagram https://www.instagram.com/j_utah99/ Twitter https://twitter.com/jutah99",[],2,03062025

This journey takes us through the scenic landscapes of New England and down the East Coast, navigating a mix of city skylines, suburban sprawls, and the open highway.  History of Boston and New York   • Founding: Boston was established in 1630 by Puritan settlers, while New York, initially called New Amsterdam, was founded by the Dutch in 1624. When the British took control of New Amsterdam in 1664, renaming it New York, the city began to compete more directly with Boston, which was already an important center of Puritan culture and commerce.  • Religious and Cultural Differences: Boston was deeply rooted in Puritan values, while New York, due to its Dutch origins, was more religiously and culturally diverse. This set the stage for the distinct identities that each city would carry into the modern era.  If you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe and I will create more videos like it.

At the end of the last ice age, humans began inhabiting the mountain range. After explorations of the range by Europeans, natural resources such as mineral and fur drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains, although the range itself never experienced a dense population.  Of the 100 highest peaks in the Rocky Mountains, 78 (including the 30 highest) are located in Colorado, ten in Wyoming, six in New Mexico, three in Montana, and one in Utah. Public parks and forest lands protect much of the mountain range, and they are popular tourist destinations, especially for hiking, camping, mountaineering, fishing, hunting, mountain biking, skiing, and snowboarding.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains",[],2,03062025

The larger urban area surrounding the city, known as Antananarivo-Renivohitra (""Antananarivo-Mother Hill"" or ""Antananarivo-Capital""), is the capital of Analamanga region. The city sits at 1,280 m (4,199 ft) above sea level in the center of the island, the highest national capital by elevation among the island countries. It has been the country's largest population center since at least the 18th century. The presidency, National Assembly, Senate and Supreme Court are located there, as are 21 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of many national and international businesses and NGOs. It has more universities, nightclubs, art venues, and medical services than any city on the island. Several national and local sports teams, including the championship-winning national rugby team, the Makis are based here.  Antananarivo was historically the capital of the Merina people, who continue to form the majority of the city's estimated 1,300,000 (2013) inhabitants. The surrounding urban areas have a total metropolitan population approaching three million. All 18 Malagasy ethnic groups, as well as residents of Chinese, Indian, European and other origins, are represented in the city. It was founded circa 1610, when the Merina King Andrianjaka (1612–1630) expelled the Vazimba inhabitants of the village of Analamanga. Declaring it the site of his capital, Andrianjaka built a rova (fortified royal dwelling) that expanded to become the royal palaces of the Kingdom of Imerina. The city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710), who renamed it Antananarivo (""City of the Thousand"") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers.  The city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Imerina until 1710, when Imerina split into four warring quadrants. Antananarivo became the capital of the southern quadrant until 1794, when King Andrianampoinimerina of Ambohimanga captured the province and restored it as capital of a united Kingdom of Imerina, also bringing neighboring ethnic groups under Merina control. These conquests continued under his son, Radama I, who eventually controlled over two-thirds of the island, leading him to be considered the King of Madagascar by European diplomats. Antananarivo remained the island's capital after Madagascar was colonized by the French in 1897, and after independence in 1960.  The city is now managed by the Commune Urbaine d'Antananarivo (CUA) under the direction of its President of the Special Delegation, Ny Havana Andriamanjato, appointed in March 2014. Limited funds and mismanagement have hampered consecutive CUA efforts to manage overcrowding and traffic, waste management, pollution, security, public water and electricity, and other challenges linked to explosive population growth. Major historic landmarks and attractions in the city include the reconstructed royal palaces and the Andafiavaratra Palace, the tomb of Rainiharo, Tsimbazaza Zoo, Mahamasina Stadium, Lake Anosy, four 19th-century martyr cathedrals, and the Museum of Art and Archaeology.

SUBSCRIBE IF YOU ❤️. 🎥 Recorded on Saturday, January, 11, 2020  📍 Maps: https://goo.gl/maps/H5bTUU2rPD3dqNuDA 📸 Visit Antananarivo (in french): https://www.tourisme-antananarivo.com/index.php/fr/ ✈ Air Madagascar: https://www.airmadagascar.com/en  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antananarivo Antananarivo, also known by its colonial shorthand form Tana, is the capital and largest city of Madagascar. The larger urban area surrounding the city, known as Antananarivo-Renivohitra (""Antananarivo-Mother Hill"" or ""Antananarivo-Capital""), is the capital of Analamanga region. The city sits at 1,280 m (4,199 ft) above sea level in the center of the island, the highest national capital by elevation among the island countries. It has been the country's largest population center since at least the 18th century. The presidency, National Assembly, Senate and Supreme Court are located there, as are 21 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of many national and international businesses and NGOs. It has more universities, nightclubs, art venues, and medical services than any city on the island. Several national and local sports teams, including the championship-winning national rugby team, the Makis are based here.  Antananarivo was historically the capital of the Merina people, who continue to form the majority of the city's estimated 1,300,000 (2013) inhabitants. The surrounding urban areas have a total metropolitan population approaching three million. All 18 Malagasy ethnic groups, as well as residents of Chinese, Indian, European and other origins, are represented in the city. It was founded circa 1610, when the Merina King Andrianjaka (1612–1630) expelled the Vazimba inhabitants of the village of Analamanga. Declaring it the site of his capital, Andrianjaka built a rova (fortified royal dwelling) that expanded to become the royal palaces of the Kingdom of Imerina. The city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710), who renamed it Antananarivo (""City of the Thousand"") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers.  The city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Imerina until 1710, when Imerina split into four warring quadrants. Antananarivo became the capital of the southern quadrant until 1794, when King Andrianampoinimerina of Ambohimanga captured the province and restored it as capital of a united Kingdom of Imerina, also bringing neighboring ethnic groups under Merina control. These conquests continued under his son, Radama I, who eventually controlled over two-thirds of the island, leading him to be considered the King of Madagascar by European diplomats. Antananarivo remained the island's capital after Madagascar was colonized by the French in 1897, and after independence in 1960.  The city is now managed by the Commune Urbaine d'Antananarivo (CUA) under the direction of its President of the Special Delegation, Ny Havana Andriamanjato, appointed in March 2014. Limited funds and mismanagement have hampered consecutive CUA efforts to manage overcrowding and traffic, waste management, pollution, security, public water and electricity, and other challenges linked to explosive population growth. Major historic landmarks and attractions in the city include the reconstructed royal palaces and the Andafiavaratra Palace, the tomb of Rainiharo, Tsimbazaza Zoo, Mahamasina Stadium, Lake Anosy, four 19th-century martyr cathedrals, and the Museum of Art and Archaeology.

If you're less keen on driving or prefer to linger for longer at the lagoons and restaurants, then you can do the eastern side one day and the western side the next.around in Vanuatu besides walking, which I did plenty of, was sitting in the back of a truck.  This footage takes you from the market in downtown Vila up to the Parliament building. Driving in Vanuatu is unlike driving at home. In fact it is unlike driving anywhere. To start we drive on the right hand side of the road and driver is on the left of the vehicle.  Speed limit is 50km around town and 80km is the maximum in outer areas. So it’s not fast, and just as well, because once you have achieved the idea of driving on the wrong side, you then have to navigate the pot holes, the other drivers, poor road marking/signage and pedestrians.  Public transport in Port Vila is mainly by small buses and there are lots of them. The condition of the road changes throughout the year subject to budgets within the government, however being tropical when it rains it really does pour! And our roads are washed away.  It is highly recommended to hire a 4 wheel drive vehicle, if only for safety and comfort. The other up side of this is that you really can explore. Although the ring road around the island was sealed in 2011 it was also damaged in some areas by cyclone Pam, March 2015. It is also the only ring road that is sealed. Anywhere that is of interest is surely accessed by a dirt road and as insurance does not cover wheels, tyres, undercarriage or windscreens it can be a very costly decision to take an unsuitable vehicle to these areas.  The island is 136kms around and although that doesn’t sound like much it really takes a couple of days of adventuring to enjoy the best of it and see all the hidden gems. Fabulous restaurants for lunch and several local food houses. There is a Blue Lagoon, Turtle Beach, hot springs, waterfall, World War Museum and Havannah Harbor to name just a few. Paradise cove, Pango for great surfing and Honeymoon beach are in an altogether different direction.  Driving in Vanuatu So come and explore, take it easy, take it slow. Paradise is not to be rushed.

Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it is bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region of China in the north, the Chumbi Valley of Tibet, China and the Indian states of Sikkim and West Bengal in the west, and the Indian states of Assam, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh in the south and east. Bhutan is geopolitically in South Asia and is the regions second-least-populous nation after the Maldives. Thimphu is its capital and the largest city, while Phuntsholing is its financial center. Bhutans independence has endured for centuries. It has never been colonized in its history. Situated on the ancient Silk Road between Tibet, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, the Bhutanese state developed a distinct national identity based on Buddhism. Headed by a spiritual leader known as the Zhabdrung Rinpoche, the territory comprised many fiefdoms and was governed as a Buddhist theocracy. Following a civil war in the 19th century, the House of Wangchuck reunited the country and established relations with the British Empire. After the end of the British Raj, Bhutan fostered a strategic partnership with India during the rise of Chinese communism; it has a disputed border with China. In the early 1990s, the government deported much of the countrys Nepali-speaking Lhotsampa minority, sparking a refugee crisis in nearby Jhapa, Nepal. In 2008, Bhutan transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy and held the first election to the National Assembly of Bhutan. The National Assembly is part of the bicameral parliament of the Bhutanese democracy.

A really gorgeous image is created by its quaint small church, Creole homes, sandy beach, and pontoon over the azure sea.  The Church of St. Henry of Les Anses-d'Arlet is without a doubt one of the most photographed locations in all of Martinique since it is perfectly aligned with the pontoon on the beach.

In the next upcoming videos after this, I explore some of the beaches and towns in the area so stay tuned for more!  The municipality gets its name due to the famous uninhabited ""Rocher du Diamant"" (Diamond Rock) that is 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) from the coast of Pointe Diamant.  Rocher du Diamant is a 175 meter high (574 ft) basalt island located south of ""Grande Anse du Diamant"" before arriving from the south at Fort-de-France, the main port of the Caribbean island of Martinique.  The island was conquered, fortified and inhabited for 17 months by the English at the beginning of the 19th century before being taken over by the French.  It is notable for having been commissioned by the British Empire's Royal Navy as HMS Diamond Rock, a ""stone frigate"" serving from February 1804 until June 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars, when the First French Empire captured the rock in the Battle of Diamond Rock and held it until the British recaptured it in the invasion of Martinique in 1809.  Diamond Rock was returned to French control as part of a postwar trade of Martinique in 1815, and it remains part of Martinique in the present day.",[],1,03062025

It is located in central Namibia in the Khomas Highland plateau area, at around 1,700 m (5,600 ft) above sea level, almost exactly at the country's geographical centre. The population of Windhoek, which was 486,169 in 2023, is constantly growing due to a continued migration from other regions in Namibia.  Windhoek is the social, economic, political, and cultural centre of the country. Nearly every Namibian national enterprise, governmental body, educational and cultural institution is headquartered there.  The city developed at the site of a permanent hot spring known to the local pastoral tribes. It developed rapidly after Jonker Afrikaner, Captain of the Orlam, settled there in 1840 and built a stone church for his community. In the decades following, multiple wars and armed hostilities resulted in the neglect and destruction of the new settlement. Windhoek was founded a second time in 1890 by Imperial German Army Major Curt von François, when the territory was colonised by the German Empire.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windhoek  #windhoek, #namibia, #dsnevada",[],1,03062025

As of March 2024, Dushanbe had a population of 1,564,700, with this population being largely Tajik. Until 1929, the city was known in Russian as Dyushambe, and from 1929 to 1961 as Stalinabad,[d] after Joseph Stalin. Dushanbe is located in the Gissar Valley, bounded by the Gissar Range in the north and east and the Babatag, Aktau, Rangontau and Karatau mountains in the south, and has an elevation of 750–930 m. The city is divided into four districts: Ismail Samani, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, and Shah Mansur.  In ancient times, what is now or is close to modern Dushanbe was settled by various empires and peoples, including Mousterian tool-users, various neolithic cultures, the Achaemenid Empire, Greco-Bactria, the Kushan Empire, and Hephthalites. In the Middle Ages, more settlements began near modern-day Dushanbe such as Hulbuk and its famous palace. From the 17th to early 20th century, Dushanbe grew into a market village controlled at times by the Beg of Hisor, Balkh, and finally Bukhara, before being conquered by the Russian Empire. Dushanbe was captured by the Bolsheviks in 1922, and the town was made the capital of the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924, which commenced Dushanbe's development and rapid population growth that continued until the Tajik Civil War. After the war, the city became capital of an independent Tajikistan and continued its growth and development into a modern city, today home to many international conferences.  Much of Dushanbe's education system dates from Soviet times and has a legacy of state control; today the largest university in Dushanbe, the Tajik National University, is funded by the government. Dushanbe International Airport is the primary airport serving the city. Other forms of transport include the trolleybus system dating from 1955, the small rail system, and the roads that traverse the city. Dushanbe's electricity is primarily hydroelectric, produced by the Nurek Dam, and the aging water system dates from 1932. Tajikistan's healthcare system is concentrated in Dushanbe, meaning that the major hospitals of the country are in the city. The city makes up 20% of Tajikistan's GDP and has large industrial, financial, retail, and tourism sectors. Parks and main sights of the city include Victory Park, Rudaki Park, the Tajikistan National Museum, the Dushanbe Flagpole, and the Tajikistan National Museum of Antiquities.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushanbe  #dushanbe #tajikistan #dsnevada",[],1,03062025

Today it was one of those days when you get home and you're all emotional.   After doing the funeral for one of our children at the Feeding Center 😭 we were heading home only to get into this potentially very dangerous situation.   In the morning, the taxi drivers were protesting against a rule by the City Counsel to move the place where they can wait for customers. As we approached Zomba, I saw some large stones in the middle of the road. Thinking the protest is over by now - it was after 4:00 PM after all - I decided to proceed. Long story short, a car behind me panicked, passed me and a few more vehicles only to do a quick U turn at the top of a small hill. At that point I knew something was happening up there and decided to turn back, only to realize they’ve blocked the road behind me as well. Me and a few more vehicles were trapped. Fortunately enough, there was a small dirt road to the left, THE ONLY large enough for vehicles. I took it but people were shouting, telling me the bridge on the way to town has been destroyed as well.   The protesters  were upset about the rules that affect them so, in order to make a point, some destroy everything they can. A foreigner in a vehicle is a good target as, in some of their minds, any such incident may cause an international outrage - thus bringing attention to their grievances.   Let me add this: Malawian people are very peaceful, Malawi is known as “the warm heart of Africa” for a reason. At the same time, many people suffer and some get frustrated because life is tough here , so incidents that everyone may regret can happen. I also should add that most people demonstrating are peaceful, but there are always those few thugs that take advantage of the commotion.   The main road would’ve taken us home in about 5 minutes from the point in this incident. Instead, I had to take that forced detour, so to avoid the dangerous spots. It took me more than 1 hour, driving in places I’ve never been before, on some awful roads.   I'm grateful I got home safe and sound but this is just another example of why one needs to be vigilant and asses the situation every time. It can literally make the difference between arriving home safe or not.   Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.",[],1,03062025

Do you still remember these streets and buildings, or is it look new to you?  Comment below, I would love to hear your story in this downtown. _____________________________________________________________________  ABOUT STOCKTON: Stockton is a city and the county seat of San Joaquin County in the Central Valley of the U.S. state of California. Stockton was founded by Carlos Maria Weber in 1849 after he acquired Rancho Campo de los Franceses. The city is named after Robert F. Stockton, and it was the first community in California to have a name not of Spanish or Native American origin. The city is located on the San Joaquin River in the northern San Joaquin Valley and had an estimated population of 312,697 by the California Department of Finance for 2019. Stockton is the 13th largest city in California and the 62nd largest city in the United States. It was named an All-America City in 1999, 2004, 2015 and again in 2017.  Built during the California Gold Rush, Stockton's seaport serves as a gateway to the Central Valley and beyond. It provided easy access for trade and transportation to the southern gold mines. The University of the Pacific (UOP), chartered in 1851, is the oldest university in California, and has been located in Stockton since 1923. In 2012 Stockton filed for what was then the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history, which had multiple causes including financial mismanagement in the 1990s, generous fringe benefits to unionized city employees, and the 2008 financial crisis. Stockton successfully exited bankruptcy in February 2015.

863,4JT1m_AyT3g,Driving through streets of Windhoek - Namibia - Africa,25062023,UCWHGvEw5IAiVNdISRuFrkew,802,"The driest country in sub-Saharan Africa,[17] Namibia has been inhabited since pre-historic times by the Khoi, San, Damara and Nama people. Around the 14th century, immigrating Bantu peoples arrived as part of the Bantu expansion. Since then, the Bantu groups, the largest being the Ovambo, have dominated the population of the country; since the late 19th century, they have constituted a majority. With a population of an estimated 2.77 million people today, Namibia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world.  In 1884, the German Empire established rule over most of the territory, forming a colony known as German South West Africa. Between 1904 and 1908, German troops waged a punitive campaign against the Herero and Nama which escalated into the first genocide of the 20th century. German rule ended during the First World War with a 1915 defeat by South African forces. In 1920, after the end of the war, the League of Nations mandated administration of the colony to South Africa. From 1948, with the National Party elected to power, this included South Africa applying apartheid to what was then known as South West Africa. In the later 20th century, uprisings and demands for political representation by native African political activists seeking independence resulted in the United Nations assuming direct responsibility over the territory in 1966, but the country of South Africa maintained de facto rule. In 1973, the UN recognized the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) as the official representative of the Namibian people. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. However, Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands remained under South African control until 1994.  Namibia is a stable parliamentary democracy. Agriculture, tourism and the mining industry – including mining for gem diamonds, uranium, gold, silver and base metals – form the basis of its economy, while the manufacturing sector is comparatively small. Namibia is a member state of the United Nations, the Southern African Development Community, the African Union and the Commonwealth of Nations.",[],1,03062025

It has been the national capital since the French protectorate of Cambodia and has grown to become the nation's primate city and its economic, industrial, and cultural center.  The city was nicknamed the ""Pearl of Asia"" for its early 20th century colonial French architecture, which included Art Deco works.[10] Phnom Penh, along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is noted for its historical architecture and attractions. It became the national capital in 1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so until 1497.[11] It regained its capital status during the French colonial era in 1865. There are a number of surviving colonial-era buildings scattered along the grand boulevards.    Phnom Penh succeeded Angkor Thom as the capital of the Khmer nation but was abandoned several times before being reestablished in 1865 by King Norodom. The city formerly functioned as a processing center, with textiles, pharmaceuticals, machine manufacturing, and rice milling. Its chief assets, however, were cultural. Institutions of higher learning included the Royal University of Phnom Penh (established in 1960 as Royal Khmer University), with schools of engineering, fine arts, technology, and agricultural sciences, the latter at Chamkar Daung, a suburb. Also located in Phnom Penh were the Royal University of Agronomic Sciences and the Agricultural School of Prek Leap.[9]    On the banks of the Tonlé Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers, Phnom Penh is home to more than 2 million people, approximately 14% of the Cambodian population.[4] The Greater Phnom Penh area includes the nearby Ta Khmau city and some districts of Kandal province.[12]    Website : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh  Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdTQ6GG6zVNJLLdMgj96PnA  Camera  : Gopro Hero 8 Black  Editor Programming : Capcut",[],1,03062025

1308,biaaHNOsI3I,[4K] Anocheciendo en FRAY BENTOS [histórica CIUDAD de la costa Oriental del Río URUGUAY] #driving,12072023,UCqxXkhoVKkfa4LwlYQ-ie5Q,4152,"Imágenes 4K conduciendo por  las calles de la Ciudad de Fray Bentos en la Republica Oriental del Uruguay en el mes de junio del año 2023 Fray Bentos es una ciudad que se encuentra en la República Oriental del Uruguay y es capital del departamento de Río Negro. Fue fundada oficialmente el 16 de abril de 1859, aunque su origen es anterior. Inicialmente se llamó Villa Independencia y en 1900 cambió su nombre a Fray Bentos. Su población a 2011 era de 24 406 habitantes.   Algunos historiadores consideran que al instalarse en su territorio la Compañía Liebig, se inició la Revolución Industrial en el Río de la Plata.  Está ubicada sobre la margen este del río Uruguay, cuenta con un puerto ultramarino de aguas profundas y se encuentra unida a la provincia de Entre Ríos, República Argentina, por la obra binacional ""Puente Libertador General San Martín"".  Desde 2006 la ciudad cobró mayor notoriedad por el conflicto fronterizo producido por la construcción y posterior instalación de la planta productora de pasta de celulosa de la empresa finlandesa Botnia, actualmente UPM.  En julio del 2015 fue incluida en la lista del patrimonio de la Humanidad por la Unesco, dentro del conjunto «Paisaje Cultural Industrial Fray Bentos».[3]​   El nombre Fray Bentos acarrea cierta incertidumbre, no obstante hay coincidencia en que podría provenir de un fraile de apellido Bentos, un religioso ermitaño que se instaló en la zona denominada hoy como ""Caracoles"", sobre el río Uruguay. En la cartografía desde la mitad del 1600, comienza a figurar como toponímico ""FrayVento"" lo que induce a pensar que para tener importancia y ser reconocido como lugar geográfico, debería haber tenido varias décadas de uso.   El fechamiento del término Fray Bentos lleva a los investigadores a referencias muy atrás en el tiempo. Ya en 1692, un viaje por el Río de la Plata y sus afluentes, hecha por el capitán Manuel de Ibarbelz, siguiendo órdenes del entonces gobernador de Buenos Aires, Don Agustín de Robles, da cuenta en su diario y anotaciones cartográficas sobre las ""barrancas de Fray Bentos"", además de otras observaciones detalladas de la geografía inconfundible de los alrededores de la ciudad.  En otro ámbito de investigación, el historiador uruguayo Ariosto Fernández, haciendo referencia a la ""Carta Española del Río de la Plata, Uruguay y Paraná"" (época de Felipe V, 1703), realizada por el capitán de Ingenieros Gregorio Gómez, descubre la referencia al toponímico Fray Bentos.  Otra documentación que menciona el nombre Fray Bentos es el mapa ""De las Misiones de la Compañía de Jesús en los ríos Paraná y Uruguay"", delineado por un sacerdote jesuita de nombre Joseph Quiroga y Méndez, en 1749. Este mapa fue posteriormente publicado por Franceschelli en el año 1753 en Italia. El mapa en cuestión se refiere a cursos de agua y menciona ""Fray Bentos"" como uno de ellos, nombre que hoy sigue llevando un arroyo al sur de la ciudad, el mismo observado por Quiroga y Méndez.  Durante el período de gobierno de Juan Manuel de Rosas en Buenos Aires, el río Uruguay se abrió a la navegación y se fomentó la exportación por vías acuáticas. En 1855 el puerto de la ciudad de Gualeguaychú no daba abasto con el comercio existente, además de tener dificultades con el calado que no permitía el ingreso de embarcaciones de regular tamaño, obligando a las mismas a recalar en el ""atracadero de Fray Bentos"", sobre la costa oriental. En la otra orilla, las barrancas ofrecían un excelente puerto natural, pero no había allí ningún centro poblado.[4]​  El Dr. Isidoro de María, vicecónsul uruguayo en la ciudad de Gualeguaychú, comenzó a alentar la radicación de personas en la orilla oriental y a despertar el interés de inversores en una zona que prometía mucho futuro. Por entonces, 1857, un hombre de negocios radicado en la ciudad de Gualeguaychú, el vasco-francés José Hargain, decidió instalar una hostería en la orilla de Fray Bentos, tarea que llevó adelante no sin antes solicitar permiso a la familia Haedo propietaria de las tierras, de manera que Hargain fue el primer poblador de la zona específica de lo que sería posteriormente la ciudad de Fray Bentos.  En 1858, un grupo de empresarios uruguayos, ingleses, alemanes e irlandeses, provenientes de Montevideo, compraron las tierras y donaron al gobierno uruguayo las manzanas suficientes como para fundar allí lo que inicialmente se llamó ""Villa Independencia"" (16 de abril de 1859).

Está ubicada en la ribera norte —izquierda— del Río de la Plata, a 177 kilómetros de Montevideo y frente a las costas de Buenos Aires, Argentina, de la que dista solo unos 50 kilómetros (en línea recta).  Se encuentra emplazada sobre el cabo que forman las puntas de San Pedro y Santa Rita. Su casco antiguo, el barrio histórico que comprende 12 hectáreas del extremo occidental de la ciudad, fue declarado Patrimonio de la Humanidad en 1995 al ilustrar la fusión exitosa de los estilos portugués, español y poscolonial. El plano es de origen portugués y contrasta con el estándar que prescribía la ley española sobre las Indias Occidentales. Se caracteriza por sus calles angostas de piedra, que resaltan su tradición militar.  Su proximidad con la ciudad de Buenos Aires la vincula fuertemente con esta. Son numerosos los viajeros que llegan y parten con ese destino y también los habitantes de Buenos Aires que tienen propiedades en ella. Existe un proyecto para unir ambas márgenes a través de un puente binacional. La distancia entre ambas ciudades cruzando por el Puente Libertador General San Martín es de unos 500 kilómetros.",[],1,03062025

When I was in Martinique, because a lot of roads look so similar, when it came to long drives, I did quite a bit of editing to make it bearable to watch.  Because Dominica was so unique and filled with marvelous beautiful plant life on the road to Roseau, I wanted to show you everything.  So this video will be 2 of 3 videos, that's how long the drive was.  It took me 1 hour and a 30 min from the north left side to get through the island and to the lower right side.  Hope you enjoy, and stay tuned for the other parts.  From the airport, you drive out and make a right and right passed the yellow bridge, you make the first left and that should be Dr. Nicholas Liverpool Highway.  You keep following that until you get to a circle and then keep straight after that onto Imperial Road.  Then you keep left onto Edward Oliver Leblanc Highway which is also Goodwill Road until you reach Roseau.

It draws about 25,000 tourists per year[1] and is a major La Paz tourist attraction.[2] Many tour operators cater to downhill mountain biking, providing information, guides, transport, and equipment. At least 18 cyclists have died on the road since 1998.[1] The tourist route is a 64 km-long road with 3500 meters of descent.[3]  The route includes the Cotapata-Santa Bárbara section. It replaced the old road, built in 1930. It was considered dangerous[1] because of its steep slopes, narrow single track, lack of guardrails, rain, and fog, and was nicknamed the ""Road of Death"". However, it was not the most dangerous road in the region.[4] Unlike the rest of the country, traffic was left-hand, to allow the driver to assess the distance of their outer wheel from the edge of the road.[5]  A new alternative route, now part of Route 3, was built during a 20-year period ending in 2006. The modernization included enlarging the carriageway from one to two lanes; asphalt paving; bridges, drainage, guardrails, and the building of a new section between Chusquipata and Yolosa, bypassing the most dangerous sections of the original road.",[],1,03062025

'City of the Brahma's Faces') or shortly known as Krong Chaktomuk (Khmer: ក្រុងចតុមុខ),[8] is the capital and most populous city in Cambodia. Phnom Penh has been the national capital since French colonization of Cambodia, and has grown to become the nation's economic, industrial, and cultural center.  Once known as the ""Pearl of Asia,"" it was considered one of the loveliest French-built cities in Indochina[9] in the 1920s. Phnom Penh, along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is noted for its historical architecture and attractions. It became the national capital in 1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so until 1497.[10] It regained its capital status during the French colonial era in 1865. There are a number of surviving colonial-era buildings scattered along the grand boulevards.  On the banks of the Tonlé Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers, Phnom Penh is home to more than 2 million people, approximately 14% of the Cambodian population.[3] The Phnom Penh metropolitan area includes 5 districts of Kandal Province.[11]  #PhnomPenh #CityView",[],1,03062025

Muscat (Arabic: مَسْقَط, Masqaṭ pronounced [ˈmasqatˤ]) is the capital and most populated city in #oman. It is the seat of the Governorate of #muscat. According to the National Centre for Statistics and Information (NCSI), the total population of Muscat Governorate was 1.4 million as of September 2018. The metropolitan area spans approximately 3,500 km2 (1,400 sq mi) and includes six provinces called wilayats.[citation needed] Known since the early 1st century AD as an important trading port between the west and the east, Muscat was ruled by various indigenous tribes as well as foreign powers such as the Persians, the Portuguese Empire, the Iberian Union and the Ottoman Empire at various points in its history. Since the ascension of Qaboos bin Said as Sultan of Oman in 1970, Muscat has experienced rapid infrastructural development that has led to the growth of a vibrant economy and a multi-ethnic society. Muscat is termed as a Beta - Global City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The rocky Western Al Hajar Mountains dominate the landscape of Muscat. The city lies on the Arabian Sea along the Gulf of Oman and is in the proximity of the strategic Straits of Hormuz. Low-lying white buildings typify most of Muscat's urban landscape, while the port-district of Muttrah, with its corniche and harbour, form the north-eastern periphery of the city. Muscat's economy is dominated by trade, petroleum, liquified natural gas and porting.  The city has numerous mosques including the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, Ruwi Mosque, Saeed bin Taimoor and Zawawi Mosque. A few Shi'ite mosques also exist here. Muscat has a number of museums.

The Majority of roads within the park are closed during the winter so this is the main route until the snow is cleared in spring time.  Same goes for Yellowstone National Park.  Since we can't see the peaks of the actual Tetons, I guess we'll all just have to come back in the summer for another video! Route: https://goo.gl/maps/qsy3Qu1sg9BzyGJb6 .  Grand Teton National Park is in the northwest of the U.S state of Wyoming. It encompasses the Teton mountain range, the 4,000-meter Grand Teton peak, and the valley known as Jackson Hole. It’s a popular destination in summer for mountaineering, hiking, backcountry camping and fishing, linked to nearby Yellowstone National Park by the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway.  https://goo.gl/maps/w9CKGrwuP4zL48tX8  Grand Teton National Park is an American national park in northwestern Wyoming. At approximately 310,000 acres (480 sq mi; 130,000 ha; 1,300 km2), the park includes the major peaks of the 40-mile-long (64 km) Teton Range as well as most of the northern sections of the valley known as Jackson Hole. Grand Teton National Park is only 10 miles (16 km) south of Yellowstone National Park, to which it is connected by the National Park Service-managed John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Along with surrounding national forests, these three protected areas constitute the almost 18,000,000-acre (7,300,000 ha) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, one of the world's largest intact mid-latitude temperate ecosystems.  Efforts to preserve the region as a national park began in the late 19th century, and in 1929 Grand Teton National Park was established, protecting the Teton Range's major peaks. The valley of Jackson Hole remained in private ownership until the 1930s, when conservationists led by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. began purchasing land in Jackson Hole to be added to the existing national park. Against public opinion and with repeated Congressional efforts to repeal the measures, much of Jackson Hole was set aside for protection as Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943. The monument was abolished in 1950 and most of the monument land was added to Grand Teton National Park.  Grand Teton National Park is named for Grand Teton, the tallest mountain in the Teton Range. The naming of the mountains is attributed to early 19th-century French-speaking trappers—les trois tétons (the three teats) was later anglicized and shortened to Tetons. At 13,775 feet (4,199 m), Grand Teton abruptly rises more than 7,000 feet (2,100 m) above Jackson Hole, almost 850 feet (260 m) higher than Mount Owen, the second-highest summit in the range. The park has numerous lakes, including 15-mile-long (24 km) Jackson Lake as well as streams of varying length and the upper main stem of the Snake River. Though in a state of recession, a dozen small glaciers persist at the higher elevations near the highest peaks in the range. Some of the rocks in the park are the oldest found in any American national park and have been dated at nearly 2.7 billion years.  Grand Teton National Park is an almost pristine ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. More than 1,000 species of vascular plants, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, more than a dozen fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians inhabit the park. Due to various changes in the ecosystem, some of them human-induced, efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened whitebark pine.  Grand Teton National Park is a popular destination for mountaineering, hiking, fishing and other forms of recreation. There are more than 1,000 drive-in campsites and over 200 miles (320 km) of hiking trails that provide access to backcountry camping areas. Noted for world-renowned trout fishing, the park is one of the few places to catch Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout. Grand Teton has several National Park Service-run visitor centers, and privately operated concessions for motels, lodges, gas stations and marinas.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Teton_National_Park",[],1,03062025

Starting Point:  https://goo.gl/maps/bWBRUExoaqk . Fort Lauderdale (frequently abbreviated as Ft. Lauderdale) is a city in the U.S. state of Florida, 28 miles (45 km) north of Miami.   The city is a popular tourist destination, with an average year-round temperature of 75.5 °F (24.2 °C), and 3,000 hours of sunshine per year. Greater Fort Lauderdale which takes in all of Broward County hosted 12 million visitors in 2012, including 2.8 million international visitors. The city and county in 2012 collected $43.9 million from the 5% bed tax it charges, after hotels in the area recorded an occupancy rate for the year of 72.7 percent and an average daily rate of $114.48. The district has 561 hotels and motels comprising nearly 35,000 rooms. Forty six cruise ships sailed from Port Everglades in 2012. Greater Fort Lauderdale has over 4,000 restaurants, 63 golf courses, 12 shopping malls, 16 museums, 132 nightclubs, 278 parkland campsites, and 100 marinas housing 45,000 resident yachts.  Fort Lauderdale is named after a series of forts built by the United States during the Second Seminole War. The forts took their name from Major William Lauderdale (1782–1838), younger brother of Lieutenant Colonel James Lauderdale. William Lauderdale was the commander of the detachment of soldiers who built the first fort. However, development of the city did not begin until 50 years after the forts were abandoned at the end of the conflict. Three forts named ""Fort Lauderdale"" were constructed; the first was at the fork of the New River, the second at Tarpon Bend on the New River between the Colee Hammock and Rio Vista neighborhoods, and the third near the site of the Bahia Mar Marina.  Economy Fort Lauderdale's economy has diversified over time. From the 1940s through the 1980s, the city was known as a spring break destination for college students. However, the college crowd has since dwindled, with the city now attracting wealthier tourists. Cruise ships and nautical recreation provide the basis for much of the revenue raised by tourism. There is a convention center located west of the beach and southeast of downtown, with 600,000 square feet (55,742 m2) of space, including a 200,000-square-foot (18,581 m2) main exhibit hall. Approximately 30% of the city's 10 million annual visitors attend conventions at the center.  The downtown area, especially around Las Olas Boulevard, first underwent redevelopment starting in 2002 and now hosts many new hotels and high-rise condominium developments. The downtown area is the largest in Broward County, although there are other cities in the county with commercial centers. Office buildings and highrises include Las Olas River House, Las Olas Grand, 110 Tower (formerly AutoNation Tower), Bank of America Plaza, One Financial Plaza, Broward Financial Center, One East Broward Boulevard, Barnett Bank Plaza, PNC Center, New River Center, One Corporate Center, SunTrust Centre, 101 Tower, and SouthTrust Tower.  Fort Lauderdale is a major manufacturing and maintenance center for yachts. The boating industry is responsible for over 109,000 jobs in the county. With its many canals, and proximity to the Bahamas and Caribbean, it is also a popular yachting vacation stop, and home port for 42,000 boats, and approximately 100 marinas and boatyards.[24] Additionally, the annual Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show, the world's largest boat show, brings over 125,000 people to the city each year.  Companies based in the Fort Lauderdale area include AutoNation, Citrix Systems, DHL Express, Spirit Airlines, and National Beverage Corporation. The largest employers in the county are Tenet Healthcare, which employs 5,000 people; American Express, which employs 4,200; The Continental Group, which employs 3,900; Motorola, which employs 3,000, and Maxim Integrated Products, which employs 2,000.

Our route will take us on the historic Highway 191, which is the main road to Arches National Park. It's an easy-to-navigate route with well-maintained roads. The drive itself is part of the adventure, with the changing landscapes providing endless photo opportunities and scenic pull-offs to enjoy a picnic or simply take in the views.  Just before reaching Moab, you'll get a sneak peek at the majestic La Sal Mountains. These snow-capped peaks in the winter rise dramatically above the red rocks, creating a breathtaking contrast that photographers and nature enthusiasts will appreciate.  Finally, we'll reach our destination, Arches National Park, home to over 2,000 natural sandstone arches. The park's entrance is just a short drive from Moab, and once inside, you'll be in awe of the breathtaking formations that nature has sculpted over millions of years. The sight of Delicate Arch, Balanced Rock, and the Windows Section will leave you speechless.  Thank you for joining us on this unforgettable road trip from Castle Gate to Arches National Park.

Home to the Concours d’Elegance car show, AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, Pebble Beach Golf Links, celebrities, CEO's, and 32 million dollar homes.  This is about 2 hours south of San Francisco.  So its a good day trip if you can make time for it.  Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/t5ziL1oxtLV6wyQA7 . Pebble Beach is an unincorporated community on the Monterey Peninsula in Monterey County, California. The small coastal residential community of mostly single-family homes is also notable as a resort destination, and the home of the golf courses of Cypress Point Club, Monterey Peninsula Country Club, and Pebble Beach Golf Links.  The Pebble Beach Golf Links, The Inn at Spanish Bay, The Lodge at Pebble Beach and four of the eight golf courses inside the Pebble Beach community are among the local assets owned by the Pebble Beach Company. Residents pay road fees for maintenance as well as Monterey County property taxes. Application of the property tax revenues is the realm of the Pebble Beach Community Services District, a public agency that is independent of local private facilities, e.g., golf courses, with an elected Board of Directors that manages essential functions including fire protection and emergency medical services, supplemental law enforcement, wastewater collection and treatment, recycled water distribution, and garbage collection, disposal and recycling. The community's post office is named Pebble Beach, as is its identity; whereas, the U.S. Census Bureau aggregates census returns from Pebble Beach as part of the larger census-designated place of Del Monte Forest. However, residents and visitors associate and identify with the name Pebble Beach; boundaries of the Del Monte Forest extend outside of the Pebble Beach community boundaries encompassing a larger forest area that comprises the wooded parts of Monterey Peninsula.  Area open space is partly administered by the Del Monte Forest Conservancy, a non-profit organization designated by Monterey County and the California Coastal Commission to acquire and manage certain properties by conservation easement and, as well, by fee title. The Conservancy is governed by a self-elected volunteer board of up to 12 members working with a small part-time group of contractors and volunteers to preserve the open space within the Del Monte Forest and non-forested sites of Pebble Beach. All board members must be property owners and residents of Pebble Beach.  Pebble Beach lies at sea level, its ZIP Code is 93953, and the community is inside area code 831.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach,_California  Golf Pebble Beach has seven 18-hole golf courses, and one 9-hole course. Pebble Beach Golf Links, The Links at Spanish Bay, Spyglass Hill and Peter Hay Golf Course are owned by Pebble Beach Company and are all public courses. Poppy Hills is also a public course. Private courses located at Pebble Beach are Cypress Point Club and the private Monterey Peninsula Country Club's two courses, the Dunes Course and the Shore Course. Pebble Beach Company also owns Del Monte Golf Course a few miles away in Monterey, which is the oldest continuously operating course in the Western United States.  Several of these courses are widely celebrated, especially Pebble Beach Golf Links. Designed by Jack Neville and Douglas Grant, it is the most famous course in the Western United States, and along with Augusta National remains one of only two courses to have ever beaten Pine Valley Golf Club to top spot in Golf Digest's biennial list of America's 100 greatest courses. Pebble Beach Golf Links was the site of the US Open in 1972, 1982, 1992, 2000, 2010 and 2019. The course is set to host the tournament again in 2027.  The AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am (formerly known as the Crosby Clambake) is held on three of the courses here annually in February. The tournament began in 1937 at Rancho Santa Fe near San Diego, where it was last played in 1942. After World War II, it moved to Pebble Beach in 1947, and has continued annually since.  The Pebble Beach golf resort partnered with IBM in 2017 to use the artificial intelligence Watson as a live concierge embedded in a mobile app. Watson was used to guide visitors around the resort.  Concours d'Elegance The annual Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance auto show has been held in Pebble Beach since 1950. The event focuses on classic cars, and each year features a particular marque as its focus. In addition to the car competition, there is an auction, a classic car tour, and an automotive art exhibit.",[],1,03062025

It then makes its way through Pebble Beach and Big Sur along PCH Pacific Coast highway and we end in Lucia because the bridge is out because of storms a few years ago that haven't been repaired yet on PCH.     Route Overview: Monterey, Pebble Beach, and Big Sur form a scenic trio along California's rugged Central Coast, each offering unique experiences and stunning natural beauty.  Monterey: Monterey is a charming coastal city known for its rich history, vibrant marine life, and beautiful coastline. Once a thriving fishing town, it’s now famous for Cannery Row, a waterfront street made iconic by author John Steinbeck. Monterey Bay is home to a world-class Aquarium, where visitors can observe the diverse marine life of the Pacific Ocean, including sea otters, sharks, and jellyfish. The city also boasts the historic Old Fisherman’s Wharf, where you can enjoy fresh seafood and whale watching tours. Monterey's natural beauty extends inland with nearby hiking trails, lush parks, and the stunning 17-Mile Drive that connects the area to Pebble Beach.  Pebble Beach: Pebble Beach is synonymous with luxury and prestige, especially for golf enthusiasts. It is home to the world-famous Pebble Beach Golf Links, a stunning course perched on cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. This scenic coastal enclave offers jaw-dropping vistas along the 17-Mile Drive, where visitors can take in landmarks like The Lone Cypress, a solitary tree perched on a rocky outcrop. The shoreline is rugged, dotted with dramatic rock formations, and framed by cypress groves. Aside from its famed golf courses, Pebble Beach is known for exclusive estates and is a part of the luxurious atmosphere of the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, an annual luxury car show.  Big Sur: Big Sur, to the south, is a rugged and awe-inspiring stretch of coastline where the Santa Lucia Mountains dramatically plunge into the Pacific Ocean. Known for its breathtaking cliffs, towering redwood trees, and secluded beaches, Big Sur is a haven for nature lovers and road trippers. Highway 1, which winds through Big Sur, offers one of the most scenic drives in the world. Notable stops include Bixby Creek Bridge, an iconic arched bridge spanning a deep canyon, and Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, where redwoods meet the sea. Big Sur’s remote beauty has attracted artists, writers, and travelers seeking solace in nature’s grandeur, offering hiking trails, secluded coves, and stunning overlooks.

1729,Dq4heV1ZvH4,SUR CITY🇴🇲 One of the Oldest Ports in the World | Ep 2 - Driving in Oman,,UCqixOyDg4B-L54hyRIm9E2w,25519,"Sur is one of the oldest ports in the world. It's about 200 km east of the capital Muscat. Compared to the capital city, Sur is much more peaceful and calm.  Tourists come to the city for some sightseeing tours. Examples include 'Turtle-Hatching' and 'Dolphin-Watching'. However, even without such tourist activities, Sur is still an attractive city.  I just drove around the city, visited restaurants, and rested at the hotel. These alone were enough to enjoy Sur. I hope this city will never change and I want to visit again someday.  🚗 Previous video ╰ MUSCAT CITY - https://youtu.be/GyD0jH7AlSk  🎈 Contact ╰ INSTAGRAM - https://instagram.com/korearoadtour ╰ EMAIL - korearoadtour@gmail.com",[],1,03062025

Piroozi neighborhood of Tehran is one of the famous neighborhoods that has an old urban texture next to the new texture. Of course, this neighborhood, like most areas and neighborhoods of Tehran, is growing and building apartments, and its old texture is becoming less and less. Piroozi neighborhood is located in the east of Tehran in districts 13 and 14. Shemiran Gate is one of the old and historical neighborhoods of Tehran, which is located in the center of Tehran today and in the 12th district of Tehran Municipality. One of the northern gates of old Tehran was located in this area and the route from Tehran to Shemiran passed through it.Sayyad Shirazi Highway (former name: Niavaran Highway) is the name of a highway in Tehran.

1921,AOqCW1ACOGA,Driving Downtown - Ft Lauderdale Beach 4K - USA,,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,204647,"Beach Town Driving - Fort Lauderdale Beach Florida USA - Episode 6. Starting Point:  https://goo.gl/maps/FQ1saMDTtEo . Fort Lauderdale (frequently abbreviated as Ft. Lauderdale) is a city in the U.S. state of Florida, 28 miles (45 km) north of Miami.   The city is a popular tourist destination, with an average year-round temperature of 75.5 °F (24.2 °C), and 3,000 hours of sunshine per year. Greater Fort Lauderdale which takes in all of Broward County hosted 12 million visitors in 2012, including 2.8 million international visitors. The city and county in 2012 collected $43.9 million from the 5% bed tax it charges, after hotels in the area recorded an occupancy rate for the year of 72.7 percent and an average daily rate of $114.48. The district has 561 hotels and motels comprising nearly 35,000 rooms. Forty six cruise ships sailed from Port Everglades in 2012. Greater Fort Lauderdale has over 4,000 restaurants, 63 golf courses, 12 shopping malls, 16 museums, 132 nightclubs, 278 parkland campsites, and 100 marinas housing 45,000 resident yachts.  Economy Fort Lauderdale's economy has diversified over time. From the 1940s through the 1980s, the city was known as a spring break destination for college students. However, the college crowd has since dwindled, with the city now attracting wealthier tourists. Cruise ships and nautical recreation provide the basis for much of the revenue raised by tourism. There is a convention center located west of the beach and southeast of downtown, with 600,000 square feet (55,742 m2) of space, including a 200,000-square-foot (18,581 m2) main exhibit hall. Approximately 30% of the city's 10 million annual visitors attend conventions at the center.  The downtown area, especially around Las Olas Boulevard, first underwent redevelopment starting in 2002 and now hosts many new hotels and high-rise condominium developments. The downtown area is the largest in Broward County, although there are other cities in the county with commercial centers. Office buildings and highrises include Las Olas River House, Las Olas Grand, 110 Tower (formerly AutoNation Tower), Bank of America Plaza, One Financial Plaza, Broward Financial Center, One East Broward Boulevard, Barnett Bank Plaza, PNC Center, New River Center, One Corporate Center, SunTrust Centre, 101 Tower, and SouthTrust Tower.  The Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area foreclosures increased 127.4% from 2006 to 2007, or one filing per 48 households in the quarter. Fort Lauderdale ranks fourth in the list of top 10 metropolitan areas ranked by foreclosure filings per household for the third quarter of 2007.  Fort Lauderdale is a major manufacturing and maintenance center for yachts. The boating industry is responsible for over 109,000 jobs in the county. With its many canals, and proximity to the Bahamas and Caribbean, it is also a popular yachting vacation stop, and home port for 42,000 boats, and approximately 100 marinas and boatyards. Additionally, the annual Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show, the world's largest boat show, brings over 125,000 people to the city each year.  Companies based in the Fort Lauderdale area include AutoNation, Citrix Systems, DHL Express, Spirit Airlines, and National Beverage Corporation. The largest employers in the county are Tenet Healthcare, which employs 5,000 people; American Express, which employs 4,200; The Continental Group, which employs 3,900; Motorola, which employs 3,000, and Maxim Integrated Products, which employs 2,000.  Gulfstream International Airlines, a commuter airline, is headquartered in nearby Dania Beach. An Online Trading Academy center is also located in the city.  Lifestyle As is true of many parts of Florida, the city's population has a strong seasonal variation, as snowbirds from the northern United States, Canada, and Europe north spend the winter and early spring in Florida. The city is also sometimes referred to as ""Fort Liquordale"" because of its beaches, bars, nightclubs, and history as a spring break location, back in the 1960s and 1970s, for tens of thousands of college students. However, the city has actively discouraged college students from visiting the area since the mid-1980s, passing strict laws aimed at preventing the mayhem that regularly occurred each year in the 1970's and 1980's. The city had an estimated 350,000 college visitors for spring break 1985; by 2006, that number had declined to about 10,000. Since the 1990's, Fort Lauderdale has increasingly become a location that caters to those seeking the resort lifestyle seasonally or year round and is often a host city to many professional venues, concerts, and art shows.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g34227-Activities-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html",[],1,03062025

Once known as the ""Hay Shipping Capital of the World"",[5] it is the sixth-largest municipality in Arizona and the fifth-largest in the Phoenix metro area. It covers an area of nearly 69 square miles (179 km2).  Gilbert has made a rapid transformation from an agriculture-based community to an economically diverse suburban center located in the southeast valley of the Greater Phoenix area. It has grown at an extremely high rate over the last three decades, increasing in population from 5,717 in 1980 to 208,453 as of the 2010 census. The town grew at an average annual rate of nearly 13% during this 30-year period. In 2019, the town's population was estimated to be 254,114.  History[edit] Gilbert was established by William ""Bobby"" Gilbert, who provided land to the Arizona Eastern Railway in 1902 to construct a rail line between Phoenix and Florence, Arizona. Ayer's Grocery Store, the first store in Gilbert, opened in 1910 and became the location of the first post office in 1912. The location of the town post office moved several times before settling on the east side of Gilbert Road in downtown, where it still stands today. In 1912, many Mormons who had fled the Mormon colonies in Mexico due to the actions of the forces of Pancho Villa settled in Gilbert. By 1915, they began holding church meetings at the Gilbert Elementary School. In 1918, they were organized into the Gilbert Ward.[6]  Incorporated in July 1920, Gilbert was primarily a farming community fueled by the rail line and construction of the Roosevelt Dam and the Eastern and Consolidated Canals. It remained an agricultural town for many years and was known as the ""Hay Capital of the World""[7] from 1911 until the late 1920s.  In 2019, the town featured highly on three national surveys, related to safety, livability and family life; it was named the fourth-safest (of 182 communities), twelfth-most livable town, and seventh-best place to raise a family in the United States.[8]  Demographics[edit]  This section is in list format, but may read better as prose.

Jeddah (English: /ˈdʒɛdə/ JED-ə), also spelled Jedda, Jiddah or Jidda (/ˈdʒɪdə/ JID-ə; Arabic: جِدَّة‎, romanized: Jidda, Hejazi pronunciation: [ˈdʒɪd.da]), is a city in the Hejaz region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the country's commercial center. It is not known when Jeddah was founded, but Jeddah's prominence grew in 647 when the Caliph Uthman made it a travel hub serving Muslim travelers going for Islamic pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. Since those times, Jeddah has served as the gateway for millions of pilgrims who have arrived in Saudi Arabia, traditionally by sea and recently by air.[3][4] With a population of about 4,697,000 people as of 2021, Jeddah is the largest city in Makkah Province,[5] the largest city in Hejaz, the second-largest city in the Saudi Arabia (after the capital Riyadh), and the ninth-largest in the Middle East. It also serves as the administrative centre of the OIC. Jeddah Islamic Port, on the Red Sea, is the thirty-sixth largest seaport in the world[6] and the second-largest and second-busiest seaport in the Middle East (after Dubai's Port of Jebel Ali).  Jeddah is the principal gateway to Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, 65 kilometers (40 mi) to the east, while Medina, the second-holiest city, is 360 kilometers (220 mi) to the north. Economically, Jeddah is focusing on further developing capital investment in scientific and engineering leadership within Saudi Arabia, and the Middle East.[7] Jeddah was ranked fourth in the Africa, Middle East, and 'stan countries region in the Innovation Cities Index in 2009.[8]  Jeddah is one of the Saudi Arabia's primary resort cities and was named a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). Given the city's close proximity to the Red Sea, fishing and seafood dominate the food culture unlike other parts of the country. In Arabic, the city's motto is ""Jeddah Ghair"", which translates to ""Jeddah is different"". The motto has been widely used among both locals as well as foreign visitors. The city is widely perceived as the most liberal city in Saudi Arabia and is a popular tourist destination in the region.

Siesta Beach (sometimes known as Siesta Key Beach) is a beach located on Siesta Key, Florida, United States. The sand is 99% pure quartz, soft and cool on the feet.[1]  The many awards it has earned include:  ""the whitest and finest sand in the world"" (The Great International Beach Challenge, 1987), ""The Best Sand Beach in America"" (The Travel Channel, 2004), ""The Best Beach in America"" (Dr. Beach, 2011).[2] 2015 awarded #1 U.S. Beach (TripAdvisor source Orlando Sentinel February 18, 2015) Siesta Beach is located on Beach Road on Siesta Key. Siesta Beach is known as one of the most beautiful beaches anywhere in the world.[citation needed] At the ""Great International White Sand Beach Challenge"" held in 1987, it was recognized as having the ""whitest and finest sand in the world.""   A panoramic photograph of Siesta Beach on an overcast day in December 2012, which illustrates the characteristic white sand and expansive width of the beach. Unlike beaches elsewhere that are made up mostly of pulverized coral, Siesta Beach's sand is 99% quartz, most of which coming from the Appalachian Mountains.[3] Even on the hottest days, the sand is so reflective that it feels cool underfoot. It's estimated that the sand on Siesta Beach and Crescent Beach on Siesta Key is millions of years old, having its origin in the Appalachians and flowing down the rivers from the mountains until it eventually was deposited on the shores of Siesta Key.  Shallow water depth in the near shore area together with year round lifeguard protection, makes this one of the safest beaches in the county and great for small children.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siesta_Beach  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siesta_Key,_Florida",[],1,03062025

Starting Point: Court St  https://goo.gl/maps/DMk26L5DCiJ2 . Tacoma is a mid-sized urban port city in and the county seat of Pierce County, Washington, United States.[6] The city is on Washington's Puget Sound, 32 miles (51 km) southwest of Seattle, 31 miles (50 km) northeast of the state capital, Olympia, and 58 miles (93 km) northwest of Mount Rainier National Park. The population was 198,397, according to the 2010 census.[7] Tacoma is the second-largest city in the Puget Sound area and the third largest in the state. Tacoma also serves as the center of business activity for the South Sound region, which has a population of around 1 million people.  Tacoma adopted its name after the nearby Mount Rainier, originally called Takhoma or Tahoma. It is locally known as the ""City of Destiny"" because the area was chosen to be the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the late 19th century. The decision of the railroad was influenced by Tacoma's neighboring deep-water harbor, Commencement Bay. By connecting the bay with the railroad, Tacoma's motto became ""When rails meet sails."" Today, Commencement Bay serves the Port of Tacoma, a center of international trade on the Pacific Coast and Washington State's largest port.  Like most central cities, Tacoma suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of suburbanization and divestment. Since the 1990s, developments in the downtown core include the University of Washington Tacoma; Tacoma Link, the first modern electric light rail service in the state; the state's highest density of art and history museums; and a restored urban waterfront, the Thea Foss Waterway. Neighborhoods such as the 6th Avenue District have become revitalized.  Tacoma-Pierce County has been named one of the most livable areas in the United States.[8] In 2006, Tacoma was listed as one of the ""most walkable"" cities in the country.[9] That same year, the women's magazine Self named Tacoma the ""Most Sexually Healthy City"" in the United States.[10] In contrast, Tacoma was also ranked as the ""most stressed-out"" city in the country in a 2004 survey.[11]  Tacoma gained notoriety in 1940 for the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which earned the nickname ""Galloping Gertie"".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington  http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g58775-Activities-Tacoma_Washington.html  http://www.traveltacoma.com/  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tacoma-Washington/108707615821090",[],1,03062025

New Haven, in the U.S. state of Connecticut, is the principal municipality in Greater New Haven, which had a total population of 862,477 in 2010.[2] It is located on New Haven Harbor on the northern shore of Long Island Sound in New Haven County, Connecticut, which in turn comprises the outer limits of the New York metropolitan area. It is the second-largest city in Connecticut (after Bridgeport), with a population of 129,779 people as of the 2010 United States Census.[3] According to a census of 1 July 2012, by the Census Bureau, the city had a population of 130,741.  New Haven was founded in 1638 by English Puritans, and a year later eight streets were laid out in a four-by-four grid, creating what is now commonly known as the ""Nine Square Plan"",[4] now recognized by the American Institute of Certified Planners as a National Planning Landmark. The central common block is New Haven Green, a 16-acre (6 ha) square, now a National Historic Landmark and the center of Downtown New Haven.  New Haven is the home of Yale University. The university is an integral part of the city's economy, being New Haven's biggest taxpayer and employer.[5] Health care (hospitals and biotechnology), professional services (legal, architectural, marketing, and engineering), financial services, and retail trade also help to form an economic base for the city.  The city served as co-capital of Connecticut from 1701 until 1873, when sole governance was transferred to the more centrally located city of Hartford. New Haven has since billed itself as the ""Cultural Capital of Connecticut"" for its supply of established theaters, museums, and music venues.  New Haven had the first public tree planting program in America, producing a canopy of mature trees (including some large elms) that gave New Haven the nickname ""The Elm City"".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut  Yale University is an American private Ivy League research university in New Haven, Connecticut. Founded in 1701 in Saybrook Colony as the Collegiate School, the University is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States. The school was renamed Yale College in 1718 in recognition of a gift from Elihu Yale, who was governor of the British East India Company. Established to train Congregationalist ministers in theology and sacred languages, by 1777 the school's curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences. In the 19th century the school incorporated graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first Ph.D. in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887.[6]  Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the University owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, including the Yale Bowl, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forest and nature preserves throughout New England. The university's assets include an endowment valued at $25.6 billion as of September 2015, the second largest of any educational institution.[7] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[8][9]  Yale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and are organized into a system of residential colleges. Almost all faculty teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[10] Students compete intercollegiately as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League.  Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 13 living billionaires,[11] and many foreign heads of state. In addition, Yale has graduated hundreds of members of Congress and many high-level U.S. diplomats. 52 Nobel laureates, 5 Fields Medalists, 230 Rhodes Scholars, and 118 Marshall Scholars have been affiliated with the University.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University  http://www.flytweed.com/visiting-ct/visiting-new-haven/  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g33851-Activities-New_Haven_Connecticut.html",[],1,03062025

Starting Point:  https://goo.gl/maps/UzBgHh1tav12 .   Greenwich is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States.  It is home to many hedge funds and other financial service companies. Greenwich is the southernmost and westernmost municipality in Connecticut. It is 38+ minutes by train (express) from Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. The largest town on Connecticut's Gold Coast, CNN/Money and Money magazine ranked Greenwich first on its list of the ""100 Best Places to Live in the United States"" in 2005.[2] The town is named after Greenwich, a borough of London in the United Kingdom.[3]  Wealth Both the Official AENGLC Wealth Value and the CPR AENGLC Wealth Value show Greenwich as having the highest wealth value in Connecticut at over $930,000 per person. The AENGLC is based on the value of residential and commercial real estate and measures the town's tax base available to pay for public education(see Conn. Dep of Ed). It is not a measure of the personal wealth of individual residents. New Canaan is the wealthiest town in Connecticut, with a per capita income of $100,824, second is Darien at $95,577 and Greenwich third at $92,759 per the 2010 Census. Median family income in New Canaan at $220,278 also is higher than Greenwich at $167,825.  Greenwich was the highest income place with a population of 50,000 or more in 2000. However, using the list of the 100 richest places in the United States with at least 1,000 households yields a different result. This is the most common list used for referring to the richest communities in the country, as it eliminates any places with unsubstantial populations. On this list Greenwich ranks 56th after New Canaan at 30th, Darien at 42nd, and Weston at 55th.  The median price for a single-family home in town was $1.7 million in 2006, when about 140 properties sold for $5 million or more, according to Prudential Connecticut Realty. In 2007, the highest asking prices for residential property in town were $39.5 million for the 76-acre (310,000 m2) estate of actor Mel Gibson on Old Mill Road, $19.7 million for a 13,000-square-foot (1,200 m2) mansion on 8.7 acres (35,000 m2) with a private lake, and $38 million for an estate with formal gardens and a greenhouse the size of a cottage.[21]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich,_Connecticut",[],1,03062025

Starting Point: Duval Street & United Street - https://goo.gl/maps/i3S4aR4NUKw . Duval Street (/ˈduvəhl/) is a famous downtown commercial zoned street in Key West, Florida, running north and south from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean. From shore to shore, the street is just over 1.25 miles in length. It is named for William Pope Duval, the first territorial governor of Florida.  Duval Street was designated a “Great Street” in 2012 by the American Planning Association.[1] The beautiful Bahamian and Spanish influenced Victorian Mansions of Duval Street have been well preserved through local preservation efforts starting in the 1960s. On the Atlantic Ocean end of Duval Street there is a mix of early Key West Victorian mansions and bungalows’ dotting the neighborhood. Art galleries, boutiques, inns and Bodega’s line the wide sidewalks. Although this end of Duval is more residential and less filled with tourists, the sidewalks still bustle with activity.  Near the southern terminus of Duval Street is the buoy marker for the southernmost spot in the United States not far from the southernmost House, a striking Victorian architecture mansion built in 1896. A favorite of both Harry S. Truman and author Ernest Hemingway, the building was restored to its formal beauty and opulence with a $3 million renovation in 1996.  Duval Street well represents the cultural influence of Key West’s proximity and cultural ties to Cuba. Many Cubans immigrated to the area beginning in the late 1860s. At one time, the many cigar stores on Duval gave the city the moniker “Cigar City USA.” There are many pleasant outdoor cafes to enjoy another Cubano influenced product, “Cuban Coffee”, which is espresso made from roasted Cuban Coffee beans with a heavy dose of sugar.  At the north end, tourists from the cruise ships that dock at the Westin harbor complex, Mole pier or Mallory Square are often seen traversing Duval Street's many shops [1] in the afternoon looking for souvenir trinkets and T-shirts. The streets are congested with Pedi cabs, trollies, bikes, mopeds, cars, and the Conch Train all adding to the touristy feel of this heavily visited end of Duval.  Near the northern end of the street is Mallory Square. Historic Mallory Square is the center of Key West’s waterfront. The City of Key West and Duval Street share their beginning along this deep harbor waterfront.  On certain nights, the gulf shores of Duval Street often vibrate with a carnival like atmosphere that lasts until dawn and beyond. In fact, the ritual has a name known to tourists and residents as the “Duval Pub Crawl.” Duval is the location of many famous restaurants and bars, including Sloppy Joe's, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, which is the original, Fogarty's Restaurant, Bar and Bakery, ""The Flying Monkeys Bar"", The Bull and Whistle, Rick's Cafe and Irish Kevin's bar. Tour outlets book the “Duval Pub Crawl” activity and provide knowledgeable guidance for the tourist wishing to visit and imbibe at the famous drinking establishments, for a fee.  A 1967 National Park Service survey of Historic American Buildings designated 18 buildings as historic. A full six blocks were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Further protection for this historically significant street has been created through the City’s, “Historic Architecture Guidelines,” approved in 2000, which sets standards for construction on Duval Street.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duval_Street  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_West,_Florida  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g34345-Activities-Key_West_Florida_Keys_Florida.html  http://keywest.com/  https://www.facebook.com/floridakeysandkeywest",[],1,03062025

Starting Point:  Duval Street - https://goo.gl/maps/J92ouVGPJLv . Key West is a city in and the county seat of Monroe County, Florida, United States. The city encompasses the island of Key West, the part of Stock Island north of U.S. 1 (the Overseas Highway) (east), Sigsbee Park (north, originally known as Dredgers Key), Fleming Key (north), and Sunset Key (west, originally known as Tank Island). Both Fleming Key and Sigsbee Park are part of Naval Air Station Key West and are inaccessible by civilians. Key West is the county seat of Monroe County.[3] Key West is the southernmost city in the Continental United States. It also contains the southern terminus of U.S. 1, State Road A1A, the East Coast Greenway and, before 1935, the Florida East Coast Railway.  Key West is 129 miles (208 km) southwest (229.9 degrees) of Miami, Florida,[4] (about 160 miles (260 km) by car) and 106 miles (171 km) north-northeast (21.2 degrees) of Havana, Cuba.[5] Cuba, at its closest point, is 94 statute miles (151 km) south.[6] Key West is a seaport destination for many passenger cruise ships.[7] The Key West International Airport provides airline service. Hotels and guest houses are available for lodging. Naval Air Station Key West is an important year round training site for naval aviation due to the superb weather conditions. It is also a reason the city was chosen as the Winter White House of President Harry S. Truman. The central business district primarily comprises Duval Street, and includes much of the northwest corner of the island along Whitehead, Simonton, Front, Greene, Caroline, and Eaton Streets and Truman Avenue. The official city motto is ""One Human Family.""  Points of interest One of the biggest attractions on the island is a concrete replica of a buoy at the corner of South and Whitehead Streets that claims to be the southernmost point in the contiguous United States (see Extreme Points). Erected in 1983, the famous brightly painted and labeled ""SOUTHERNMOST POINT CONTINENTAL U.S.A."", it is one of the most visited and photographed attractions in Key West.[44]  However, the marker is not located at the southernmost point in the continental United States, as discussed below:  Whitehead Spit, on the Truman Annex property just west of the buoy, is the true southernmost point, but it has no marker since it is U.S. Navy land and cannot be entered by civilian tourists. The private yards directly to the east of the buoy and the beach areas of Truman Annex and Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Park also lie farther south than the buoy. The farthest-south location that the public can visit is the seaward end of the White Street Pier. Florida's, and by extension the continental United States', true physically southernmost point is Ballast Key, a private island owned by David W. Wolkowsky, a wealthy developer, about 10 miles (16 km) west of Key West. Although Ballast Key is located within both the Key West National Wildlife Refuge and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, signs on the island strictly prohibit unauthorized visitors. The claim ""90 Miles to Cuba"" on the monument is close to correct, Cuba at its closest point has been measured at 94 statute miles (151 km) from Key West.  The original Key West settlement on the western part of the island is called ""Old Town"" and comprises the Key West Historic District. It includes the major tourist destinations of the island, including Mallory Square, Duval Street, the Truman Annex and Fort Zachary Taylor. It is where are found the classic bungalows and guest mansions.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_West,_Florida  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g34345-Key_West_Florida_Keys_Florida-Vacations.html  http://www.fla-keys.com/",[],1,03062025

Downtown Jersey City is an area of Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, which includes the Historic Downtown and the Waterfront.  Like Historic Downtown, the Waterfront of Jersey City is an area rich in history and full of current development. It is the location of the end of the Morris Canal and there is still a segment of this basin surrounded by Liberty State Park. The giant Colgate Clock, next to the Goldman Sachs Tower reminds people of the industry that used to line the Hudson River on New Jersey's Coast. Many of the names of Jersey City's downtown neighborhoods come from Dutch words or Dutch names from the early inhabitants along the Hudson. Paulus Hook is a quiet mostly residential neighborhood stretching to the west from the Goldman Sachs building. Its main streets are Essex and Morris Streets and its waterfront is along the Morris Canal, where it maintains a walkway which is part of Jersey City's longer waterfront walkway. The Essex Street station on the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and the development of office buildings to the east have allowed more businesses to line Morris Street including a number of restaurants with outdoor seating. The Paulus Hook and Grove Street neighborhoods, unlike many other redeveloped neighborhoods on the Hudson have undergone the same revitalization with less gentrification. The Newport/Pavonia, Harborside Financial Center and Exchange Place neighborhoods on the waterfront are experiencing significant construction of high-rise towers and with the addition of the Light Rail and more ferry service the area has become a growing destination for businesses, residents and tourists. WALDO (work and live district overlay) is an area that is being redeveloped from its days as a warehouse center to an artist community. It is already home to several galleries and restaurants and development of artist housing, more galleries, a museum and stores are being planned. The former Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse is the building that anchors this neighborhood and when it is renovated it will maintain its shell that so many locals are used to seeing. A Trump Plaza is currently being constructed on the property to the south of the Powerhouse. In January 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration gave navigational clearance for construction of a 900-foot (270 m) residential and commercial tower planned by the Chinese Overseas America Corporation, which would succeed the Goldman Sachs Tower as the tallest skyscraper in New Jersey.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Jersey_City  Jersey City is the second most populous city in the U.S. state of New Jersey after Newark.[22] It is the seat of Hudson County as well as the county's largest city.[23][24] As of 2015, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program calculated that Jersey City's population was 264,290,[16] with the largest population increase of any municipality in New Jersey since 2010,[25] an increase of about 6.7% from the 2010 United States Census, when the city's population was at 247,597,[15][26] ranking the city the 75th largest in the nation.[27]  Part of the New York metropolitan area, Jersey City is bounded on the east by the Hudson River and Upper New York Bay and on the west by the Hackensack River and Newark Bay. A port of entry, with 21 miles (34 km) of waterfront[28] and significant rail connections, the city is an important transportation terminus and distribution and manufacturing center for the Port of New York and New Jersey. Financial and service industries as well as direct rapid transit access to Manhattan in New York City have played a prominent role in the redevelopment of the Jersey City waterfront and the creation of one of the nation's largest downtown central business districts.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_City,_New_Jersey  http://www.visitnj.org/city/jersey-city  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_City,_New_Jersey#/media/File:Jersey_City_from_a_helicopter.jpg",[],1,03062025

Financial and service industries as well as direct rapid transit access to Manhattan in New York City have played a prominent role in the redevelopment of the Jersey City waterfront and the creation of one of the nation's largest downtown central business districts.  After a peak population of 316,715 measured in the 1930 Census, the city's population saw a half-century-long decline to a low of 223,532 in the 1980 Census, but since then the city's population has grown, with the 2010 population reflecting an increase of 7,542 (+3.1%) from the 240,055 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 11,518 (+5.0%) from the 228,537 counted in the 1990 Census.  20th and 21st centuries Beginning in the 1980s, development of the waterfront in an area previously occupied by rail yards and factories helped to stir the beginnings of a renaissance for Jersey City. The rapid construction of numerous high-rise buildings increased the population and led to the development of the Exchange Place financial district, also known as 'Wall Street West', one of the largest banking centers in the United States. Large financial institutions such as UBS, Goldman Sachs, Chase Bank, Citibank, and Merrill Lynch occupy prominent buildings on the Jersey City waterfront, some of which are among the tallest buildings in New Jersey. Simultaneous to this building boom, the light-rail network was developed.[59] With 18,000,000 square feet (1,700,000 m2) of office space, it has the nation's 12th largest downtown.[60]  In November 2015, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made the claim that ""thousands and thousands"" of Muslims in Jersey City cheered as they watched the Twin Towers burn after their collapse during the September 11 terrorist attacks, and used the unsubstantiated allegation as justification for his proposal that certain mosques in the United States should be monitored by authorities.[61]  City Ordinance 13.097, passed in October 2013, requires employers with ten or more employees to offer up to five paid sick days a year. The bill impacts all businesses employing workers who work at least 80 hours a calendar year in Jersey City.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_City,_New_Jersey  https://www.facebook.com/places/Things-to-do-in-Jersey-City-New-Jersey/105756796124329/  http://www.visitnj.org/city/jersey-city  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g46531-Jersey_City_New_Jersey-Vacations.html",[],1,03062025

Newark is the largest city (by population) in the U.S. state of New Jersey, and the county seat of Essex County.[25][26] One of the nation's major air, shipping, and rail hubs, the city had a population of 277,140 in 2010.    Much of the city's retail and commercial developments are centered on Broad Street (the city's widest north/south boulevard, which once carried streetcars headed for Elizabeth and points south) and Market Street. The intersection of the two streets, known as Four Corners is widely considered to be one of the busiest in the state and at one time was considered the busiest in the country.[3]  Both Broad Street and Market Street are a bustle of activity crowded with numerous shops. Broad Street has many street vendors as well. At night however the streets are vacant and shops are closed. The City of Newark is committed to turning downtown into a ""24-hour city,"" and the downtown area is slowly beginning to develop a 24-hour presence. The former Hahne's and Lefcourt buildings are going to be converted into condominiums beginning in 2005.[needs update] Rutgers–Newark has built a six hundred bed dorm on Central Avenue. An old office building on Clinton Street has already successfully been converted to luxury lofts. Additionally, 1180 Raymond across from Military Park - Newark's second tallest building - completed a $150 million conversion to luxury apartments in 2006.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Newark  Located in the heart of New Jersey's Gateway Region, Newark is the second-largest city in the New York metropolitan area, approximately 8 miles (13 km) west of Manhattan. Port Newark, the major container shipping terminal in the Port of New York and New Jersey, is the largest on the East Coast. Newark Liberty International Airport was the first municipal commercial airport in the United States, and today is one of its busiest.[27][28][29]  Newark is headquarters to numerous corporations, such as Prudential Financial, Audible.com, Panasonic Corporation of North America and PSEG. It is also home to several universities, such as Rutgers–Newark (including the law school and medical school), the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Seton Hall University's Law School. Among others, its cultural and sports venues include the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the Prudential Center, and the Bears & Eagles Riverfront Baseball Stadium.  Newark is divided into five political wards, and contains neighborhoods ranging in character from bustling urban districts to quiet suburban enclaves. Newark's Branch Brook Park is the oldest county park in the United States and is home to the nation's largest collection of cherry blossom trees, numbering over 5,000.  Economy More than 100,000 people commute to Newark each workday,[99] making it the state's largest employment center with many white-collar jobs in insurance, finance, import-export, health-care, and government.[100] As a major courthouse venue including federal, state, and county facilities, it is home to more than 1,000 law firms. The city is also a ""college town"", with nearly 50,000 students attending the city's universities and medical and law schools.[101][102] Its airport, maritime port, rail facilities, and highway network make Newark the busiest transshipment hub on the East Coast in terms of volume.[103][104]  Though Newark is not the industrial colossus of the past, the city does have a considerable amount of industry and light manufacturing.[105] The southern portion of the Ironbound, also known as the Industrial Meadowlands, has seen many factories built since World War II, including a large Anheuser-Busch brewery that opened in 1951 and distributed 7.5 million barrels of beer in 2007.[106] The service industry is also growing rapidly, replacing those in the manufacturing industry, which was once Newark's primary economy.

Four Corners at the intersection of Broad and Market Streets in Newark, New Jersey, United States, is the site of the city's earliest settlement and the heart of Downtown that at one time was considered the busiest intersection in the United States.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corners_(Newark)  Newark is the largest city (by population) in the U.S. state of New Jersey, and the county seat of Essex County.[25][26] One of the nation's major air, shipping, and rail hubs, the city had a population of 277,140 in 2010, making it the nation's 67th most-populous municipality, after being ranked 63rd in the nation in 2000.[14] For 2015, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 281,944, an increase of 1.7% from the 2010 enumeration,[13] ranking the city the 70th largest in the nation.[27] Newark is the second largest city in the New York metropolitan area, located approximately 8 miles (13 km) west of the region's historic core, in lower Manhattan.  Several leading companies have their headquarters in Newark, including Prudential, Panasonic (North America), Audible.com, and PSEG. A number of important higher education institutions are also located in the city, including the Newark campus of Rutgers University (which includes law and medical schools and the world-renowned Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies); the New Jersey Institute of Technology; and Seton Hall University's law school. The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey holds court in the city, as well. Local cultural venues include the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark Symphony Hall, The Prudential Center, The Newark Museum, and the Bears & Eagles Riverfront Stadium.  Economy More than 100,000 people commute to Newark each workday,[100] making it the state's largest employment center with many white-collar jobs in insurance, finance, import-export, health-care, and government.[101] As a major courthouse venue including federal, state, and county facilities, it is home to more than 1,000 law firms. The city is also a ""college town"", with nearly 50,000 students attending the city's universities and medical and law schools.[102][103] Its airport, maritime port, rail facilities, and highway network make Newark the busiest transshipment hub on the East Coast in terms of volume.[104][105]  Though Newark is not the industrial colossus of the past, the city does have a considerable amount of industry and light manufacturing.[106] The southern portion of the Ironbound, also known as the Industrial Meadowlands, has seen many factories built since World War II, including a large Anheuser-Busch brewery that opened in 1951 and distributed 7.5 million barrels of beer in 2007.[107] The service industry is also growing rapidly, replacing those in the manufacturing industry, which was once Newark's primary economy. In addition, transportation has become a large business in Newark, accounting for more than 17,000 jobs in 2011.[108]  Newark is one of nine cities in New Jersey designated as eligible for Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits by the state's Economic Development Authority. Developers who invest a minimum of $50 million within 0.5 miles of a train station are eligible for pro-rated tax credit.[109][110] After the election of Cory Booker, millions of dollars of public-private partnership investment were made in Downtown development but persistent underemployment continue to characterize many of the city's neighborhoods. Poverty remains a consistent problem in Newark. As of 2010, roughly one-third of the city's population was impoverished.[93]  Newark is the third-largest insurance center in the United States, after New York City and Hartford.[117] The Prudential Financial, Mutual Benefit Life, Fireman's Insurance, and American Insurance Company all originated in the city. The first, one of the largest insurance companies in the world, has its ""home office in Newark.[118] Many other companies are headquartered in the city, including IDT Corporation, NJ Transit, Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), Manischewitz, Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey.[119][120] and Audible.com.[121] In 2013 Panasonic moved its North American headquarters to a new 250,000-square-foot (23,000 m2) office building.[122][123]  Portions of Newark are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3½% sales tax rate (versus the 7% rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants.[124]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g46671-Activities-Newark_New_Jersey.html  http://www.visitnj.org/city/newark  http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/newark-new-jersey-development-what-works-116234",[],1,03062025

Its population was measured at 38,394 by the 2010 census.  The city served as the seat of the Continental Congress in 1783–84 and was the site of the 1786 Annapolis Convention (which called for the Constitutional Convention held the following year) and the Annapolis Peace Conference, held in 2007. Annapolis is the home of St. John's College as well as the United States Naval Academy.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland  The United States Naval Academy (also known as USNA, Annapolis, or simply Navy) is a four-year coeducational federal service academy in Annapolis, Maryland, United States. Established in 1845 under Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft, it is the second oldest of the United States' five service academies, and educates officers for commissioning primarily into the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. The 338-acre (137 ha) campus is located on the former grounds of Fort Severn at the confluence of the Severn River and Chesapeake Bay in Anne Arundel County, 33 miles (53 km) east of Washington, D.C. and 26 miles (42 km) southeast of Baltimore. The entire campus is a National Historic Landmark and home to many historic sites, buildings, and monuments. It replaced Philadelphia Naval Asylum, in Philadelphia, that served as the first United States Naval Academy from 1838 to 1845 when the Naval Academy formed in Annapolis.[4]  Candidates for admission generally must both apply directly to the academy and receive a nomination, usually from a Member of Congress. Students are officers-in-training and are referred to as midshipmen. Tuition for midshipmen is fully funded by the Navy in exchange for an active duty service obligation upon graduation. Approximately 1,200 ""plebes"" (an abbreviation of the Ancient Roman word plebeian) enter the Academy each summer for the rigorous Plebe Summer, but only about 1,000 midshipmen graduate. Graduates are usually commissioned as ensigns in the Navy or second lieutenants in the Marine Corps, but a small number can also be cross-commissioned as officers in other U.S. services, and the services of allied nations. The United States Naval Academy has some of the highest paid graduates in the country according to starting salary.[5] The academic program grants a bachelor of science degree with a curriculum that grades midshipmen's performance upon a broad academic program, military leadership performance, and mandatory participation in competitive athletics. Midshipmen are required to adhere to the academy's Honor Concept.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy  http://www.visitannapolis.org/  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g29494-Annapolis_Maryland-Vacations.html  https://www.facebook.com/places/Things-to-do-in-Annapolis-Maryland/104255569609744/",[],1,03062025

Stamford is home to four Fortune 500 Companies,[2] nine Fortune 1000 Companies, and 13 Courant 100 Companies, as well as numerous divisions of large corporations. This gives Stamford the largest financial district in New York Metro outside New York City itself and one of the largest concentrations of corporations in the nation.  Economy Among the larger companies with headquarters in Stamford are Vineyard Vines, WWE, Tasty Bite, Pitney Bowes, Gen Re, Frontier Communications, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Crane Co., and Charter Communications. UBS also has its North American headquarters here and its trading floor holds the Guinness World Record as the largest column-less trading floor in the world. The Royal Bank of Scotland moved its North American operations into Stamford in 2009, including its RBS Greenwich Capital subsidiary.[14]  In recent years, many large corporations have moved offices outside of the city due to the high rental cost, including Xerox, MeadWestvaco, International Paper, GE Capital, NBC, and Clairol. The Harbor Point development, located in the South End, is one of the largest private-sector development projects in the United States.[15] Many large retail stores, such as Design within Reach and Fairway Market have moved in, along with multiple hedge funds.  History In the 1960s and 1970s, Stamford's commercial real estate boomed as corporations relocated from New York City to peripheral areas.[5] A massive urban redevelopment campaign during that time resulted in a downtown with many tall office buildings. The F.D. Rich Co. was the city-designated urban renewal developer of the downtown in an ongoing redevelopment project that was contentious, beginning in the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s. The company put up what was the city's tallest structure, One Landmark Square, at 21 floors high, and the GTE building (now One Stamford Forum), along with the Marriott Hotel, the Stamford Town Center and many of the other downtown office buildings. One Landmark Square has since been dwarfed by the new 35-story Trump Parc condominium tower (topped out), and soon by the 400-foot 39 story Ritz Carlton Hotel and Residences development, another project by the Rich Company in partnership with Cappelli Enterprises.[6] Over the years, other developers have joined in building up the downtown, a process that continued, with breaks during downturns in the economy, through the 1980s, 1990s and into the new century.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford,_Connecticut  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g33936-Activities-Stamford_Connecticut.html  http://stamford-downtown.com/  http://www.ctvisit.com/  https://twitter.com/CTvisit",[],1,03062025

Balad can literally be translated as ""The Town.""[1] Balad is the historic center of the City of Jeddah.[2]  Al-Balad was founded in the 7th century and historically served as the centre of Jeddah.[3] Al-Balad's defensive walls were torn down in the 1940s. In the 1970s and 1980s, when Jeddah began to become wealthier due to the oil boom, many Jeddawis moved north, away from Al-Balad,[4] as it reminded them of less prosperous times.[5] Al-Balad had insufficient parking space for large cars. Its stores did not sell expensive designer clothing. Poor immigrants moved in place of the Saudi population.[4] The municipality of Jeddah began historical preservation efforts in the 1970s. In 1991 the Municipality of Jeddah founded the Jeddah Historical Preservation Society to preserve the historical architecture and culture of Al-Balad. In 2002, US$4 million were earmarked for the preservation society.[5] In 2009, Al-Balad was nominated by Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquities to be added to UNESCO's World Heritage list, and it was accepted in 2014.[6]  In order to preserve the old structures within Al-Balad, the Historical Area Preservation Department was established in 1990, hoping also to help promoting cultural tourism in the country.[citation needed] The Saudi Crown Prince, Muhammad bin Salman, pledged $13.33 million to restore the old city in Jeddah as there were 56 buildings in urgent need of repair. Many Jeddawis had moved away from Al-Balad by 2007; the streets of Balad were still packed with people during the month of Ramadan.[2] Around that year the Jeddah Urban Development Company was formed to restore Al-Balad.

It is the second-largest city in Alabama, after Birmingham, and the 103rd largest in the United States. The Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area had a 2010 estimated population of 374,536. It is the fourth-largest in the state and 136th among United States metropolitan areas.  The city was incorporated in 1819, as a merger of two towns situated along the Alabama River. It became the state capital in 1846, representing the shift of power to the south-central area with the growth of cotton as a commodity crop of the Black Belt and Mobile's rise as a mercantile port. In February 1861, Montgomery was selected as the first capital of the Confederate States of America, until the seat of government moved to Richmond, Virginia, in May of that year. During the mid-20th century, Montgomery was a major site of events in the African-American Civil Rights Movement, including the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Selma to Montgomery marches.  In addition to housing many Alabama government agencies, Montgomery has a large military presence due to Maxwell Air Force Base; public universities Alabama State University, Troy University (Montgomery campus), and Auburn University at Montgomery; private colleges/universities Faulkner University and Huntingdon College; high-tech manufacturing, including Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama; and cultural attractions such as the Alabama Shakespeare Festival and Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts.

Starting Point: https://goo.gl/maps/VrVXyeW4iwp   Highlights include N Ocean Blvd - S Ocean Blvd. Myrtle Beach is a coastal city on the east coast of the United States in Horry County, South Carolina. It is situated on the center of a large and continuous stretch of beach known as the Grand Strand in northeastern South Carolina.  Myrtle Beach is one of the major centers of tourism in the United States because of the city's warm subtropical climate and extensive beaches, attracting an estimated 14 million visitors each year.[3] As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 27,109 with the Myrtle Beach metropolitan area population at 465,391 according to a 2013 estimate.

Nearly 100,000 visitors a year are estimated to come from overseas, with tourists from Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom.[5] Myrtle Beach hosts a variety of special conventions, events, and musical concerts. The area's attractions include its beaches and many golf courses, as well as a number of amusement parks, an aquarium, Legends In Concert, retail developments, a number of shopping complexes and over 1,900 restaurants[6] including seafood restaurants. The area also has dinner theaters, nightclubs, and many tourist shops. Myrtle Beach has an estimated 460 hotels, with many on the beachfront, and approximately 89,000 accommodation units in total.

After financial issues, the park became Freestyle Music Park for the 2009 season. The park features attractions themed after various genres and eras of music, such as theBritish Invasion. The park did not open for the 2010 season, and continues to be closed due to having been engulfed in legal issues. As of 2014, the park has been closed and is being dismantled.

2002,hzfLbwTYOe0,Driving Downtown - Columbia - USA,,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,98686,"Driving Downtown - Columbia South Carolina USA - Season 1 Episode 5.   Starting Point:  Main St  https://goo.gl/maps/byfCvENjjC42   Highlights include Main St - Sumter St (USC) - Assembly St - Gervais St - Lady St - Washington St - Hampton St - Taylor St - Blanding St.  Columbia is the capital of and largest city in the U.S. state of South Carolina, with a population of 129,272 as of the 2010 United States Census. As of July 1, 2013, the city's population was estimated to be 133,358 (U.S. Census Bureau, July 2014 release).   The name Columbia was a poetic term used for the United States, originating from the name of Christopher Columbus.  Columbia is home to the University of South Carolina, the state's flagship and largest university, and is also the site of Fort Jackson, the largest United States Army installation for Basic Combat Training. In 1860, the city was the location of the South Carolina Secession Convention, which marked the departure of the first state from the Union in the events leading up to the Civil War.  Downtown revitalization The city of Columbia has recently accomplished a number of urban redevelopment projects and has several more planned.[27] The historic Congaree Vista, a 1,200-acre (5 km2) district running from the central business district toward the Congaree river, features a number of historic buildings that have been rehabilitated since its revitalization begun in the late 1980s. Of note is the adaptive reuse of the Confederate Printing Plant on Gervais and Huger, used to print Confederate bills during the American Civil War. The city cooperated with Publix grocery stores to preserve the look. This won Columbia an award from the International Downtown Association.[28] The Vista district is also where the region's convention center and anchor Hilton hotel with a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse restaurant are located. Other notable developments under construction and recently completed include high-end condos and townhomes, hotels, and mixed-use structures.  The older buildings lining the Vista's main drag, Gervais, now house art galleries, restaurants, unique shops, and professional office space. Near the end of Gervais is the South Carolina State Museum and the EdVenture Children's Museum. Private student housing and some residential projects are going up nearby; the CanalSide development[29] at the site of the old Central Correctional Institution, is the most high profile. At full build-out, the development will have 750 residential units and provides access to Columbia's waterfront. Lady Street between Huger and Assembly streets in the Vista and the Five Points neighborhood have undergone beautification projects, which mainly consisted of replacing curbs and gutters, and adding brick-paved sidewalks and angled parking.  Economy Columbia enjoys a diversified economy, with the major employers in the area being South Carolina state government, the Palmetto Health hospital system, Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina, Palmetto GBA, and the University of South Carolina. The corporate headquarters of Fortune 1000 energy company, SCANA, are located in the Columbia suburb of Cayce. Other major employers in the Columbia area include Computer Sciences Corporation, Fort Jackson, the U.S. Army's largest and most active initial entry training installation,[25] Richland School District One, Humana/TriCare, and the United Parcel Service, which operates its Southeastern Regional Hub at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport. Major manufacturers such as Square D, CMC Steel, Spirax Sarco, Michelin, International Paper, Pirelli Cables, Honeywell, Westinghouse Electric, Harsco Track Tech, Trane, Intertape Polymer Group, Union Switch & Signal, FN Herstal, Solectron, and Bose Technology have facilities in the Columbia area. There are over 70 foreign affiliated companies and fourteen Fortune 500 companies in the region. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the Columbia metropolitan statistical area as of 2010 was $31.97 billion, the highest among MSAs in the state.[26]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina  http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g54184-Activities-Columbia_South_Carolina.html  http://www.columbiacvb.com/",[],1,03062025

Starting Point:  20th St  https://goo.gl/maps/A9rz55ggvuD2   Highlights include 20th St - 6th Ave - 17th St - 1st Ave - 23rd St - 2nd Ave - 3rd Ave - 4th Ave - 5th Ave - 6th Ave - 19th St - 18th St - Rev Abraham Woods Jr Blvd - 22nd St. Birmingham is the largest city in Alabama. The city is the county seat of Jefferson County. The city's population was 212,237 according to the 2010 United States Census.[3] The Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Statistical Area had a population of about 1,128,047 according to the 2010 Census, which is approximately one quarter of Alabama's population.  Birmingham was founded in 1871, during the post-Civil War Reconstruction period, through the merger of three pre-existing farm towns, notably, former Elyton. It grew from there, annexing many more of its smaller neighbors, into an industrial and railroad transportation center with a focus on mining, the iron and steel industry, and railroading. Birmingham was named for Birmingham, England, UK; one of that nation's major industrial cities. Most of the original settlers who founded Birmingham were of English ancestry.[4] In one writer's view, the city was planned as a place where cheap, non-unionized, and African-American labor from rural Alabama could be employed in the city's steel mills and blast furnaces, giving it a competitive advantage over industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast.[5]  From its founding through the end of the 1960s, Birmingham was a primary industrial center of the South. The pace of Birmingham's growth during the period from 1881 through 1920 earned its nicknames The Magic City and The Pittsburgh of the South. Much like Pittsburgh, Birmingham's major industries were iron and steel production, plus a major component of the railroading industry, where rails and railroad cars were both manufactured in Birmingham. In the field of railroading, the two primary hubs of railroading in the Deep South were nearby Atlanta and Birmingham, beginning in the 1860s and continuing through to the present day. The economy diversified during the later half of the twentieth century. Though the manufacturing industry maintains a strong presence in Birmingham, other businesses and industries such as banking, telecommunications, transportation, electrical power transmission, medical care, college education, and insurance have risen in stature. Mining in the Birmingham area is no longer a major industry with the exception of coal mining. Birmingham ranks as one of the most important business centers in the Southeastern United States and is also one of the largest banking centers in the United States. In addition, the Birmingham area serves as headquarters to one Fortune 500 company: Regions Financial, along with five other Fortune 1000 companies.  In higher education, Birmingham has been the location of the University of Alabama School of Medicine (formerly the Medical College of Alabama) and the University of Alabama School of Dentistry since 1947. Since that time it has also obtained a campus of the University of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham (founded circa 1969), one of three main campuses of the University of Alabama System. It is also home to three private institutions: Samford University, Birmingham-Southern College, and Miles College. Between these colleges and universities, the Birmingham area has major colleges of medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, law, engineering, and nursing. The city has three of the state's five law schools: Cumberland School of Law, Birmingham School of Law, and Miles Law School. Birmingham is also the headquarters of the Southeastern Conference, one of the major U.S. collegiate athletic conferences.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama  http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g30375-Activities-Birmingham_Alabama.html  http://birminghamal.org/",[],1,03062025
2005,N00aNFO5UTg,Driving Downtown - Chattanooga - USA,,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,93579,"Driving Downtown - Chattanooga Tennessee USA - Season 1 Episode 8.  Starting Point:  John Ross Bridge  https://goo.gl/maps/JdKkAbY1sNp   Highlights include Market St - Broad St - Chestnut St - MLK Blvd - 7th St - 6th St - 5th St - 4th St - 3rd St - Aquarium Way - Walnut St -  Cherry St - Riverfront Parkway. Chattanooga is the fourth-largest city in the U.S. state of Tennessee, with a population of 167,674 as of the 2010 census, and an estimated population of 171,279 in 2012.[7] The city, which has a downtown elevation of approximately 680 feet (210 m), lies at the transition between the ridge-and-valley portion of the Appalachian Mountains and the Cumberland Plateau. The city is therefore surrounded by various mountains and ridges. The official nickname for Chattanooga is the Scenic City, being reinforced by the city's growing national reputation as a haven for numerous outdoor activities. Several unofficial nicknames include River City, Chatt, Nooga, Chattown, and Gig City, demonstrating Chattanooga's claims that it has the fastest internet service in the Western Hemisphere.[8][9]  Chattanooga is internationally known for the 1941 song, the world's first gold record, ""Chattanooga Choo Choo,"" by Glenn Miller and his orchestra.  Chattanooga is home to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC) and Chattanooga State Community College.  Attractions Chattanooga touts many attractions, including the Tennessee Aquarium, caverns, and new waterfront attractions along and across the Tennessee River. In the downtown area is the Chattanooga Choo Choo Hotel, housed in the renovated Terminal Station and exhibiting the largest HO model train layout in the United States. Also downtown are the Creative Discovery Museum, a hands-on children's museum dedicated to science, art, and music; an IMAX 3D Theatre, and the newly expanded Hunter Museum of American Art. The Tennessee Riverwalk, an approximately 13-mile (21 km) long trail running alongside the river, is another attraction for both tourists and residents alike. Across the river from downtown is the North Shore district, roughly bounded by the Olgiati Bridge to the west and Veterans Bridge to the east. The newly renovated area draws locals and tourists to locally owned independent boutique stores and restaurants, plus attractions along the Chattanooga Riverpark system, including Coolidge Park and Renaissance Park.[118][119]  The Chattanooga Zoo at Warner Park is located a short distance from the downtown area. Parks and natural scenic areas provide other attractions. The red-and-black painted ""See Rock City"" barns along highways in the Southeast are remnants of a now-classic Americana tourism campaign to attract visitors to the Rock City tourist attraction in nearby Lookout Mountain, Georgia. The mountain is also the site of Ruby Falls and Craven's House.[121] The Lookout Mountain Incline Railway is a steep funicular railway that rises from the St. Elmo Historic District to the top of the mountain, where passengers can visit the National Park Service's Point Park and the Battles for Chattanooga Museum.[122] Formerly known as Confederama, the museum includes a diorama that details the Battle of Chattanooga. From the military park, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of Moccasin Bend and the Chattanooga skyline from the mountain's famous ""point"" or from vantage points along the well-marked trail system.[123] Near Chattanooga, the Raccoon Mountain Reservoir, Raccoon Mountain Caverns, and Reflection Riding Arboretum and Botanical Garden boast a number of outdoor and family fun opportunities. Other arboretums include Bonny Oaks Arboretum, Cherokee Arboretum at Audubon Acres, and Cherokee Trail Arboretum. The Ocoee River, host to a number of events at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, features rafting, kayaking, camping, and hiking. Just outside Chattanooga is the Lake Winnepesaukah amusement park. The Cumberland Trail begins in Signal Mountain, just outside of Chattanooga.  Festivals and events Chattanooga hosts the well-known Riverbend Festival, an annual nine-day music festival held in June in the downtown area. One of the most popular events is the ""Bessie Smith Strut"", a one-night showcase of blues and jazz music named for the city's most noted blues singer. The annual ""Southern Brewer's Festival"" and the ""River Roast"" festival celebrate such traditional Southern staples as beer and barbecue.  New events, such as GoFest!, the ""Between the Bridges"" wakeboard competition, Heritage Festival, and Talespin, complement well-established events, such as Riverbend and the Southern Brewer's Festival, and attract their own audiences.[124][125] Back Row Films is a city-wide celebration of film co-sponsored by the Hunter Museum of American Art, the Arts & Education Council, and UTC.[126]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee  http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g54946-Activities-Chattanooga_Tennessee.html  http://www.chattanoogafun.com/",[],1,03062025

Bahrain | Dash Cam Drive in Bahrain | Streets of Bahrain Bahrain, officially the Kingdom of Bahrain, is an island country in West Asia. It is situated on the Persian Gulf and comprises a small archipelago made up of 50 natural islands and an additional 33 artificial islands, centered on Bahrain Island which makes up around 83 per cent of the country's landmass.  Bahrain is the site of the ancient Dilmun civilization. It has been famed since antiquity for its pearl fisheries, which were considered the best in the world into the 19th century. Bahrain was one of the earliest areas to be influenced by Islam, during the lifetime of Muhammad in 628 AD. Famous for its pearls, thriving economy and rich history, Bahrain is on many a tourist's bucket list. The archipelago nation made up of 33 islands is one of the most influential hubs in the Middle East and is known for its incredible blend of ancient and modern in all aspects. Which is the most beautiful city in Bahrain? How do you say hello in Bahrain? Is Bahrain a rich country? Can you drink alcohol in Bahrain? Is there nightlife in Bahrain? What is the famous food in Bahrain? How do you say thank you in Bahrain?  Bahrain was one of the first states in the Gulf to discover oil and to build a refinery. It never reached the levels of production enjoyed by Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, and so has had to diversify its economy.  The country is ruled by a Sunni king, whose family holds the main political and military posts. The divide between the Shia majority and the Sunni rulers has led to long-running tension, which has sporadically boiled over into civil disobedience.  Bahrain was once viewed as a promising model for political reform and democratic transition, but since crushing a popular pro-democracy protest movement in 2011, the monarchy has systematically eliminated a broad range of political rights and civil liberties.      Capital: Manama     Area: 786.5 sq km     Population: 1.4 million     Languages: Arabic, also English     Life expectancy: 78 years (men) 80 years (women)  Some key dates in Bahrain's history:  1602-1783 - Persian rule.  1783 - Rule by sheikhs of the Khalifah family.  1861 - Britain assumes responsibility for Bahrain's defence and foreign relations.  1913 - Britain and the Ottoman government sign a treaty recognising the independence of Bahrain but the country remains under British administration.  1931 - The Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco), a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California (Socal), discovers oil at Jabal al-Dukhan and production begins the following year.  1967 - Britain moved its main regional naval base from Aden to Bahrain, a year before deciding to close all its bases east of Suez by 1971.  1970 - Iran under the Shah renounces claims to Bahrain, but the successor Islamic Republic of Iran does not recognise this renunciation.  1971 - Bahrain declares independence and signs a new treaty of friendship with Britain. Sheikh Isa became the first emir and the council of state became a cabinet.  1981 - Bahrain joins the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which also includes Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  1986 - Opening of the King Fahd Causeway which links Bahrain to the mainland of Saudi Arabia.  1991 - Bahrain signed a defence cooperation agreement with the United States, providing for port facilities and joint military exercises.  2001 - Referendum on political reform; Bahrainis overwhelmingly backed proposals under which Bahrain would become a constitutional monarchy with an elected lower chamber of parliament and independent judiciary.",[],1,03062025

The town owes its name to the thermal spring that was much appreciated by Queen Dona Leonor, wife of the 15th century King Dom JoãoII, who had the opportunity to confirm the curative properties of these waters when they cured her of a wound that for a long time had not healed, although she had tried various treatments. As the waters were much in demand at the time by the local people, who bathed in them to cure their ailments, the Queen ordered a hospital to be built so that they could treat themselves in some comfort. Around the hospital a village was formed, which came to be known as ""Caldas da Rainha"" (The Queen`s Hot Springs). Caldas was the birthplace of important figures in Portuguese culture, notably the painter José Malhoa (C.19), whose work can be admired in the museum named after him in the Thermal Park (Dom Carlos I garden); also born here was Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro, the 19th century caricaturist, who founded the pottery factories of Caldas da Rainha where the popular Caldas pottery began to be manufactured, of which the best known pieces are those containing characteristics humour.

The population in 2011 was 42,541, in an area of 712.10 square kilometres with 31,224 inhabitants in the city proper in 2006. Founded by King Sancho I in 1199, Guarda is the city located at the highest altitude in Portugal (1,056 m (3,465 ft) and one of the most important cities in the Portuguese region of Beira Alta. Serra da Estrela, the highest mountain range in continental Portugal, is partially located in the district. The city is served by national and international trains on the Beira Alta and Baixa railway lines. The present mayor is Carlos Chaves Monteiro, substituting for Álvaro Amaro. The municipal holiday is November 27.  Guarda is known as the ""city of the five F's"": Farta, Forte, Fria, Fiel e Formosa - abundant (or totally satisfied), strong, cold, loyal and beautiful. The explanation of the five F's is as follows:  Farta (abundant), due to the fertility of the lands of the Mondego River valley; Forte (strong), because the castle tower, the walls and its geographical location demonstrate its strength; Fria (cold), due to its proximity to Serra da Estrela; Fiel (loyal), because the Captain General of the Castle Guard, Álvaro Gil Cabral, Pedro Álvares Cabral's great-great-grandfather, refused to hand over the keys to the city to the King of Castile during the Crisis of 1383-1385 and still had the strength to participate in the Battle of Aljubarrota; Formosa (beautiful), for the natural beauty of the urban nucleus.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarda,_Portugal  Tags: Guarda, Guarda Driving, Driving 4K, Guarda city Drive, Beira Alta, Serra Estrela, 4K Drive, Sintra, Algarve, Lisbon 2021, Praia da Adraga, Adraga beach, Sintra, Praia das Maçãs, Praia Grande, Sintra Beach, Santo Amaro, Santo Amaro Beach, Paço de Arcos, Paço de Arcos Beach, Oeiras Beach, Cascais, Cascais Beach, Cascais, Lisbon Beach, Lisbon Beaches, Oeiras, Portuguese Beaches, Lisboa, Cascais walk, Beach Walk, Lisbon walk, Lisbon 2021, Cascais 2021, Cascais Beach 2021, Lisboa Summer, summer beaches, summers beaches 2021, Portugal summer 2021, Portugal Beaches, Portugal Beaches 2021, promenade cascais, promenade oeiras, promenade lisboa, लिस्बन, पुर्तगाल, ポルトガル, リスボン, 포르투갈, 리스본, البرتغال, لشبونة.  ★COPYRIGHT: All the footage was recorded and edited by me.

Most small businesses are still closed and many are gone. Tourists are starting to slowly come back but, with all of the hoops to jump through and the ongoing restrictions those numbers remain small.  The End Of The World is where Ali'i Dr used to end when heading south from town. Now we have the bypass.  This video shows what it's like during large surf at The End of The World. https://youtu.be/6Qm9iYEuM_c  On the way, I detour down to Keauhou Bay and pass by the Keauhou Sheraton Resort & Spa.  As I reach the town and the end of Ali'i Dr I continue on what then becomes Palani Rd (190) up to Queen K (Ka'ahumanu) (Hwy 19). Then I head north to Makala Blvd and turn left passing by our newer shopping area. Target, Ross, soon an Old Navy, etc... I proceed Makai to Kuakini Hwy turn right and drive through Old Kona Airport State Recreation Area. As I leave there I cross the same intersection of Kuakini Hwy and Palani Rd and the video ends just south of Henry St.  No fancy editing or cool music. Just everything I heard while driving.  I used the GoPro Hero 8 Black mounted to the inside of my windshield.  The volcano stopped erupting in 2018 and it could be years before it gets going again. I have tons of other videos I've been wanting to make so, now I can get busy on them.  Thanks for subscribing.

Located on the famous Interstate 75 (I-75), it divides the Great Lakes of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. It connects the Upper (St. Ignace) and Lower Peninsula (Mackinaw City) of Michigan.   The Mackinac Bridge opened up in 1957. When opened it was the worlds longest suspension bridge between anchorages. It was an engineering giant and an amazing story in itself. Many people lost their lives trying to build it.  Fun fact: Painting the bridge takes seven years and when its done it begins again. The bridge is constantly being painted.   Downtown St. Ignace is the gateway to Michigan's Upper Peninsula for travelers coming from the Lower Peninsula. The area was previously inhabited by Wyandot, Ojibwa and Ottawa tribes of Native Americans.

Oahu, also known as ""The Gathering Place"" is the third largest island of the state of Hawaii. It is the most populous island out of all the islands in Hawaii with a population of over one million people, which is over two-thirds of the total population of the state. The island covers almost 600 square miles of land with its highest elevation reaching 4,000 feet.  The island has been inhabited since at least the 3rd century A.D., occupied by the native Hawaiian royal kingdom since the 1700's and conquered by several monarchs throughout its history. In 1778, Captain James Cook of the British Royal Navy was the first European to visit the island which brought foreign diseases to the Native Hawaiian people and its environment.  Today, Oahu has been the most visited tourist destination and the most travelled island of Hawaii. With its capital of Honolulu, the island has been thriving with its bustling economy in tourism, trading, military defense, research & development, and manufacturing. Districts such as Waikiki and Ala Moana has been the most popular visited areas in the island.  ▬ Contents of this video  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 00:00 - Intro to Oahu, HI United States 00:20 - Uluniu Avenue 01:18 - Kalakaua Avenue 02:35 - Kapahulu Avenue 07:41 - Waialae Avenue 08:28 - Interstate H-1 14:44 - Interstate H-201 19:08 - Kamehameha Highway - Pearl Harbor 21:18 - Arizona Memorial Place 22:29 - Kamehameha Highway - Pearl Harbor 30:51 - Interstate H-2 45:36 - Dole Plantation 47:46 - Kamehameha Highway - Haleiwa 50:53 - Kamehameha Highway - North Shore  Please remember to subscribe to our channel, Like the video and hit the notification bell to help us provide you more exploration-to-go content.

2091,TjoyJ97rQwk,Driving Downtown - Hartford 4K - Connecticut USA,,UCBcVQr-07MH-p9e2kRTdB3A,206367,"Driving Downtown Streets - Main Street - Hartford Connecticut USA - Episode 73. Starting Point:  https://goo.gl/maps/MHkgeBW1ydr . Hartford is the capital of Connecticut and the historic seat of Hartford County until Connecticut disbanded county government in 1960. As of the 2010 Census, Hartford's population was 124,775,[1] making it Connecticut's third-largest city after the coastal cities of Bridgeport and New Haven. Census Bureau estimates since then have indicated Hartford's subsequent fall to fourth place statewide as a result of sustained population growth in the coastal city of Stamford.  Nicknamed the ""Insurance Capital of the World"", Hartford houses many insurance company headquarters, and insurance remains the region's major industry.[2] Founded in 1637, Hartford is among the oldest cities in the United States. Hartford is home to the nation's oldest public art museum, the Wadsworth Atheneum; the oldest publicly funded park, Bushnell Park; the oldest continuously published newspaper, The Hartford Courant; the second-oldest secondary school, Hartford Public; Trinity College, an elite, private liberal arts college, and the Mark Twain House where the author wrote his most famous works and raised his family, among other historically significant attractions. In 1868, resident Mark Twain wrote, ""Of all the beautiful towns it has been my fortune to see this is the chief.""[3]  Following the American Civil War, Hartford was the richest city in the United States for several decades.[4] Today, Hartford is one of the poorest cities in the nation with 3 out of every 10 families living below the poverty line.[5] In sharp contrast, the Hartford metropolitan area is ranked 32nd of 318 metropolitan areas in total economic production[6] and 7th out of 280 metropolitan statistical areas in per capita income. Highlighting the socio-economic disparity between Hartford and its suburbs, 83% of Hartford's jobs are filled by commuters from neighboring towns who earn over $80,000, while 75% of Hartford residents who commute to work in other towns earn just $40,000.  Economy Hartford is the historic international center of the insurance industry, with companies such as Aetna, Conning & Company, The Hartford, The Phoenix Companies, UnitedHealthcare and Hartford Steam Boiler based in the city, and companies such as Travelers and Lincoln National Corporation having major operations in the city. The city is also home to the corporate headquarters of U.S. Fire Arms and United Technologies.  From the 19th century until the mid-20th century, Hartford was a major manufacturing city. During the Industrial Revolution into the mid-20th century, the Connecticut River Valley cities produced many major precision manufacturing innovations. Among these was Hartford's pioneer bicycle (and later) automobile maker Pope.[64] As in nearly all former Northern manufacturing cities, many factories have been closed, relocated, or reduced operations.  Aetna and the Hartford Financial Services Group, both Fortune 100 companies, are headquartered in Hartford. Travelers Insurance has its largest national employment center and historical headquarters in the city. CIGNA insurance is headquartered in the region with a presence in Hartford and its suburb Bloomfield. United Health Insurance has a significant presence in the city.[65]  Hartford is a center for medical care, research, and education. Within Hartford itself the city includes Hartford Hospital, The Institute of Living, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, and Saint Francis Hospital & Medical Center (which merged in 1990 with Mount Sinai Hospital).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g33804-Activities-Hartford_Connecticut.html  https://www.facebook.com/places/Things-to-do-in-Hartford-Connecticut/108119482550253/  https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/USCT0094:1:US",[],1,03062025

The technology sector has also seen substantial expansion, driven by an increase in software development, cybersecurity, and IT services. Initiatives like the Charleston Digital Corridor have encouraged innovation and retained local talent, contributing to a vibrant tech ecosystem.  Tourism has played a significant role in Charleston’s economic development as well. Consistently ranked as a top tourist destination, the city has seen increased investment in hotels, restaurants, and cultural attractions, which have bolstered the local economy.

Starting Point: NE 8th St  https://goo.gl/maps/WXRXbu5R8Yz . Bellevue is a city in the Eastside region of King County, Washington, United States, across Lake Washington from Seattle. As Seattle's largest suburb, Bellevue has variously been characterized as an edge city, a boomburb, or satellite city.[5][6] The city had a population of 122,363 at the 2010 census.  Prior to 2008, downtown Bellevue underwent rapid change, with many high rise projects under construction, and was relatively unaffected by the economic downturn. It is currently the second largest city center in Washington state with over 35,000 employees and 5,000 residents.[7] Based on per capita income, Bellevue is the 6th wealthiest of 522 communities in the state of Washington.[8] In 2008, Bellevue was named number 1 in CNNMoney's list of the best places to live and launch a business,[9] and in 2010 was again ranked as the 4th best place to live in America.[10] The name ""Bellevue"" is French for ""beautiful view"".[11] In 2014, Bellevue was ranked as the 2nd best place to live by USA Today.[12]  Recurring cultural events Bellevue is the site of the popular annual Bellevue Arts and Crafts Fair (originally Pacific Northwest Arts and Crafts Fair), held since 1947 at the end of July. The biennial Bellevue Sculpture Exhibition draws thousands of visitors to the Downtown Park to view up to 46 three-dimensional artworks from artists around the country. In celebration of its strawberry farming history, Bellevue holds an annual Strawberry Festival.[35] The Bellevue 24-Hour Relay has also been hosted every July in Bellevue Downtown Park.  Places of interest The Bellevue Arts Museum first opened in 1975, then moved to Bellevue Square in 1983. In 2001, the museum moved into its own building, designed by Steven Holl. The museum subsequently ran into financial difficulties and was forced to close to the public in 2003. After a lengthy fundraising campaign, a remodel, and a new mission to become a national center for the fine art of craft and design, the museum reopened on June 18, 2005 with an exhibition of teapots.[36] The Rosalie Whyel Museum of Doll Art - now closed - contained one of the largest doll collections in the world—more than a thousand dolls—displayed on two floors of a Victorian-style building.[37] The KidsQuest Children's Museum is located in Marketplace @ Factoria. The museum's primary visitors are mothers and care givers with children from pre-crawlers to 12 years of age. Its 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) space houses play and discovery areas, exhibits, offices, educational activities and classroom space. Near Interstate 405 is Meydenbauer Center, a convention center that brings corporate meetings and charity events to the downtown area. Meydenbauer also includes a 410-seat theater which attracts operas, ballets, and orchestral performances.[38]  Sports and recreation Since the 1970s, the city has taken an active role in ensuring that its commercial development does not overwhelm its natural land and water resources.[39] Today, the Bellevue Parks and Community Services Department manages more than 2,500 acres (10 km2) of parks and open spaces, including the Downtown Park and the Bellevue Botanical Garden, as well as several playgrounds, beach parks, and trails. More than 5,500 Bellevue residents participate in volunteer activities through this department annually.[40]  Bellevue was home to the American Basketball Association team, the Bellevue Blackhawks. The Blackhawks in 2005, despite being ranked 13th in the league, made it to the championship game in front of 15,000 fans in Little Rock, Arkansas.[41] The team has been inactive since 2006.[42]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_based_in_Bellevue,_Washington  http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g58349-Activities-Bellevue_Washington.html",[],1,03062025

The city is known as the cradle of the automobile. As such, it is home to famous automobile museums like the Mercedes-Benz Museum and Porsche Museum, as well as numerous auto-enthusiast magazines, which contributes to Stuttgart's status as Germany's Autohauptstadt, meaning car capital city or capital of cars.
